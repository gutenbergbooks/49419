<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p>Agriculture is at the present time almost the only
industry in Ireland. This fact has frequently been
noticed and deplored. Public men of widely different
views on other matters agree in their estimate of
Ireland's economic condition, of which they give but
one explanation. Thus Mr. Gladstone, on the introduction
of the Irish Land Bill in April, 1881, spoke of
"that old and standing evil of Ireland, that land-hunger,
which must not be described as if it were merely an
infirmity of the people for it, and really means land
scarcity."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> "In Ireland," says Mr. Bright, "land, from
certain causes that are not difficult to discover, is the
only thing for the employment of the people, with the
exception of some portion of the country in the North;
the income for the maintenance of their homes, and
whatever comfort they have, or prospect of saving
money for themselves or their families, comes from
the cultivation of the soil, and scarcely at all from those
various resources to which the people of England
have recourse in the course of their industrial lives."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is generally admitted, I think, on both sides of
the House," Mr. Bright observes in another debate,
"that in discussing the Irish question one fact must
always be kept in mind&mdash;that is, that apart from the
land of Ireland there are few, if any, means of subsistence
for the population, and, consequently, there has
always been for its possession an exceptional and unnatural
demand. This, again, has led to most serious
abuses, including nearly all those constant causes of
trouble and complaint we are for ever hearing of in
Ireland."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>"The truth is," says Mr. Chaplin, from his place in
the House of Commons, "that the English Parliament
and the English people are mainly responsible for
those conditions of the country which have driven the
people to the land, and the land alone, for their
support. It was not always so; there were other
industries in Ireland in former days, which flourished,
and flourished to a considerable extent, until they
first aroused, and were afterwards suppressed by, the
selfish fears and commercial jealousy of England&mdash;England,
who was alarmed at a rivalry and competition
that she dreaded at the hands and from the
resources and energy of the Irish people."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> "I am
convinced that it is in the history of these cruel
laws that lies the secret of that fatal competition
for the land, in which&mdash;and it may well be a just
retribution upon us&mdash;the source of all the troubles
and all the difficulties that you have to deal with
will be found."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span></p>

<p>"To understand the Irish land question of to-day,"
writes Sir C. Russell, the present Attorney-General
for England, "it is necessary to look back. I have
no desire needlessly to rake up bygone wrongs.
I wish to Heaven the Irish people could forget the
past. For them it is in the main a melancholy retrospect.
But England ought not to forget the
past&mdash;until, at least, a great act of reparation has
been done. Even among men of some education in
England, remarkable ignorance of the evil wrought in
past times by England towards Ireland prevails. There
is, indeed, a vague general impression that in very
remote times England, when engaged in the endeavour
to conquer Ireland, was guilty of cruelties, as most
conquering nations are, but that those things have
done very little harm; that their effects have ceased
to tell, and that the only purpose served by keeping
alive their memory is to irritate the temper of
the Irish people and prompt them to look back
rather than look forward. Emphatically I say this
is not so. The effects have not ceased. It is not
too much to say that Ireland and Irishmen of
to-day are such as English government has made
them." Sir Charles Russell then proceeds to
place foremost among "the agencies employed by
England which have left enduring evil marks upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
Ireland," "the direct legislation avowedly contrived
to hinder the development of Irish commerce and
manufactures."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>"If people felt impatient with the Irish," said Mr.
Fawcett, addressing a political meeting at Shoreditch
on November 2nd, 1881, "they should remember that
the Irish were, to a great extent, what England had
made them. If there were some Irishmen now displaying
bitter hostility to England, it should be remembered
that for a long time Ireland had been
treated as if she had been a hostile or a foreign
country. A mass of vexatious restrictions were imposed
on her industry, and it was thought that if any
branch of Irish trade interfered with English profits,
that branch of Irish trade was immediately to be discouraged.
For a long time, for instance, to please
the agricultural interests of this country, the importation
of live cattle from Ireland was absolutely
prohibited."</p>

<p>These statements of leading public men are strong
evidence of the far-reaching effects upon Ireland of a
system which Mr. John Morley, writing on a literary
topic, has not hesitated to designate as "the atrocious
fiscal policy of Great Britain,"<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and for which Earl
Cowper, speaking at Belfast as Lord-Lieutenant of
Ireland, could find no gentler adjectives than "unjust
and iniquitous."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span></p>

<p>In the following pages I propose to exhibit
summarily the material injuries inflicted upon Ireland
by the commercial or anti-commercial arrangements
of Great Britain. With this view, I will
endeavour to sketch in outline the political relations of
Ireland to Great Britain which rendered such arrangements
possible (Chap. I.); the principal laws made by
the English Parliament in restraint of Irish trade
stating them in a plain and popular manner (Chap.
II.); the opposition of the English Government to
the efforts of the Irish Parliament to promote Irish
trade (Chap. III.); the immediate effects of English
legislation on Irish trade (Chap. IV.); the Irish
Volunteer Movement and free trade (Chap. V.);
the commercial arrangements between Great Britain
and Ireland, 1782-1800 (Chap. VI.); the commercial
arrangements effected between Great Britain and Ireland
by the Act of Legislative Union (Chap. VII.).</p>

<p>In this inquiry I will, as far as possible, confine
myself to an examination of the statutes, which will
speak for themselves; to the journals of the Parliaments
of England and Ireland; and to the statements
of contemporary speakers and writers whose accuracy
has not, so far as I am aware, been impeached.</p>

<div class="center">
THE POLITICAL RELATIONS OF IRELAND TO
GREAT BRITAIN.
</div>
</div>

<p>The interference of the English Government with
Irish trade before 1782 was twofold, direct and indirect.
The direct interference arose from statutes
passed in the English Parliament in restraint of Irish
commerce. The indirect interference arose from the
influence of the English Government over the legislation
of the Irish Parliament, under the provisions of
the statute known as Poynings' Act.</p>

<p>"From the admitted dependence," says Mr. Butt,
"of the Crown of Ireland upon that of England, arose
the claim of the English Parliament to legislate for
Ireland. Over all the colonies and dependencies of
the British Crown, the British Parliament had exercised
the right of legislation. Over Ireland they
asserted the same right. I need not tell you how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
fiercely it was contested, and that it was finally
abandoned in 1782. But, up to 1782, the right was
asserted, and occasionally exercised."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>These English statutes were chiefly aimed against
the Irish manufactures, and were, of course, clear violations
of Ireland's Parliamentary independence. The
6th Geo. I. passed by the English Parliament<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> claimed
the power of British legislation over Ireland, a power
which had been exercised long previously. "If that
power," said Mr. O'Connell, "so claimed, had really
existed, where was the necessity for passing that
statute? and while this Act proclaims the slavery of
Ireland, it admits the pre-existence of freedom."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>The nature and effects of Poynings' Act, and
the control given to the English Government by
its provisions over Irish legislation, are thus concisely
stated by Mr. Butt: "To complete our view of
the Irish Parliament, we must remember that by
an Act of that Parliament itself a most important
restriction was placed upon its legislative powers.
By an Irish Act of Parliament, passed in the reign of
Henry VII., in the year 1495, it was enacted that no
bill should be presented to the Irish Parliament until
the heads of it had been submitted to the English
Privy Council, and certified as approved of under
the Great Seal of England. This law is known as
Poynings' Law, from the name of the person who was
Lord Deputy when it was passed. This law was a
matter entirely distinct from any claim of the English
Parliament to legislate for Ireland; it was a law of
the Irish Parliament itself, passed by the King, Lords,
and Commons of Ireland, deriving its authority from
a source entirely independent of the English claim,
and continuing in force when that claim was abandoned.
The original law required the assent of the English
Privy Council to be given to the intended bill before
Parliament met. In the reign of Queen Mary it was
modified so as to admit of that assent being given
while Parliament was sitting; but that assent was
still necessary to authorise the introduction of the
bill. With this modification the law of Poynings
continued in force up to 1782."<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>We see, accordingly, that England claimed or
exercised direct legislative control in her own Parliament
over Ireland; while no Irish bills could become
law or, indeed, in strictness, be introduced into the
Irish Parliament without the sanction of the English
Privy Council.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>"Ireland," says Mr. Froude, "was regarded as a
colony to be administered, not for her own benefit,
but for the convenience of the mother country."<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

ENGLISH LEGISLATION IN RESTRAINT OF IRISH
TRADE.</div>
</div>

<p>Persons familiar with the relative economic conditions
of Great Britain and Ireland at the present
time, will find it difficult to realise that at one period
Ireland enjoyed natural advantages in no respect inferior
to those of the sister country. This, before the
development of steam-power, was undoubtedly the
fact. This would be still the case were it not for the
dearth of coal in Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The evidence of public
men of the last century, who were well acquainted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
with the circumstances of both countries, is on this
point conclusive. "Ireland," writes Edmund Burke
in 1778, "is a country in the same climate and of the
same natural qualities and productions with this
(England)."<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> "In Ireland," writes Hely Hutchinson
in 1779, "the climate, soil, growth, and productions
are the same as in England."<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Plunket, in his speech
against the Union, delivered in the Irish Parliament
on the 15th of January, 1800, draws a comparison
between England and Ireland, in which he describes
England as "another happy little island placed beside
her (Ireland) in the bosom of the Atlantic, of little
more than double her territory and population, and
possessing resources not nearly so superior to her
wants."<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
Mr. Froude's researches lead him to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
similar conclusion: "Before the days of coal and
steam, the unlimited water-power of Ireland gave her
natural advantages in the race of manufactures, which,
if she had received fair play, would have attracted
thither thousands of skilled immigrants."<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>I do not propose to furnish an exhaustive statement
of the various laws passed by the English Parliament
for the avowed purpose of destroying Irish trade and
manufactures. I will deal only with the salient
features of that system whose effects are, at the present
day, sadly apparent.</p>

<p>Till the reign of Charles II., England placed no
restriction on Irish commerce or manufactures. "Before
the Restoration," says Lord North, in the British
House of Commons, "they (the Irish) enjoyed every
commercial advantage and benefit in common with
England."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> "Ireland," writes Hely Hutchinson,
"was in possession of the English common law and
of Magna Charta. The former secures the subject in
the enjoyment of property of every kind, and by the
latter <i>the liberties of all the ports of the Kingdom
are established</i>."<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> "Our trade," says Mr. Gardiner in
the Irish House of Commons, "was guaranteed by
Magna Charta, our exports acknowledged by that
venerable statute&mdash;no treaty was made in which we
were not nominally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
or virtually included."<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> By one
of the provisions of Poynings' Law, passed in 1495, all
statutes hitherto in force in England were extended to
Ireland. Before that enactment, however, Ireland is
expressly mentioned in several English commercial
statutes, in which clauses are inserted for the protection
of her trade.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> "At this period (1495)," says Hely
Hutchinson, "the English commercial system and the
Irish, so far as it depended on English statute law,
was the same; and before this period, so far as it
depended on the common law and Magna Charta,
was also the same. From that time till the 15th of
King Charles II., which takes in a period of 167 years,
the commercial constitution of Ireland was as much
favoured and protected as that of England."<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>The first Navigation Act of 1660 put England and
Ireland on exact terms of equality.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> This community
of rights was emphasised by an Act of the following
year, which provided that foreign-built ships should
not have the privilege of ships belonging to England
and Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
"But," as Mr. Froude observes, "the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
equality of privilege lasted only till the conclusion of
the settlement and till the revenue had been assigned
to the Crown."<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> In the amended Navigation Act of
1663, Ireland was left out. Lord North, on December 13,
1779, when Prime Minister of England, in introducing a
bill to abrogate some of the restrictions on Irish trade,
thus described the Act of 1663: "The first commercial
restriction was laid on Ireland not directly, but by
a side-wind and by deductive interpretation. When
the Act (the Navigation Act of 1660) first passed
there was a general governing clause for giving bonds
to perform the conditions of the Act; but when the
Act was amended in the 15 Car. II. the word 'Ireland'
was omitted, whence a conclusion was drawn that the
Acts of the two preceding Parliaments, 12 &amp; 13
and 14 Car. II., were thereby repealed, though it was
as clearly expressed in those Acts as it was possible
for words to convey, that ships built in Ireland,
navigated with the people thereof, were deemed
British, and qualified to trade to and from British
Plantations, and that ships built in Ireland and
navigated with his Majesty's subjects of Ireland, were
entitled to the same abatement and privileges to which
imports and exports of goods in British-made ships were
entitled by the book of rates. Ireland was, however,
omitted in the manner he had already mentioned."<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>This Act, which is entitled "An Act for the
Encouragement of Trade," prohibited all <i>exports</i> from
Ireland to the colonies.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> It likewise prohibited the
importation of Irish cattle into England. It states
that "a very great part of the richest and best land
of this kingdom (England) is, and cannot so well
otherwise be employed and made use of as in the
feeding and fattening of cattle, and that by the
coming in of late in vast numbers of cattle already
fatted such lands are in many places much fallen,
and like daily to fall more in their rents and values,
and in consequence other lands also, to the great
prejudice, detriment, and impoverishment of this
kingdom;"<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> and it imposes a penalty on every head
of great cattle imported. A subsequent British Act
declares the importation of Irish cattle into England
to be "a publick and common nuisance."<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
It likewise forbids the importation of beef, pork,
or bacon. Butter and cheese from Ireland were
subsequently excluded, and the previous statute
excluding cattle was made perpetual.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> In 1670 the
exportation to Ireland from the English Plantations
of sugar, tobacco, cotton-wool, indigo, ginger, fustic
or other dyeing wood, the growth of the said Plantations,
was prohibited by statute. It is stated in
the statute that this restraint was intended by the
Act of 1663, but not effectively expressed.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>"There are," says Lord North, "anecdotes still
extant relative to the real causes of those harsh and
restrictive laws. They were supposed to have
originated in a dislike or jealousy of the growing
power of the then Duke of Ormonde, who, from his
great estate and possessions in Ireland, was supposed
to have a personal interest in the prosperity
of that kingdom. Indeed, so far was this
spirit carried, whether from personal enmity to the
Duke of Ormonde, from narrow prejudices, or
a blind policy, that the Parliament of England
passed a law to prohibit the importation of Irish
lean cattle."<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>
<p>An extensive and profitable cattle trade which
Ireland had established with Bristol, Milford, and
Liverpool was annihilated by this legislation. With
the restriction of her chief exports, her shipping trade
suffered a simultaneous eclipse. Such direct trade as
she retained was with France, Spain, and Portugal, as
if England wished to force her, in spite of herself, to
feel the Catholic countries to be her best friends.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
Till 1663 the Irish had, according to Carte, no commerce
but with England, and scarcely entertained a
thought of trafficking with other countries.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> This
writer gives melancholy evidence as to the immediate
effect of that restrictive legislation. "The people," he
says, "had no money to pay the subsidies granted by
Parliament, and their cattle was grown such a drug,
that horses that used to be sold for 30s. were now
sold for dogs' meat at 12d. apiece, and beeves that
brought before 50s. were now sold for ten."<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>Deprived of their trade, the Irish people, under
the guidance of the Duke of Ormonde, set themselves
resolutely to improve their own manufactures.
"The history of Ireland," says Chief Justice
Whiteside, "for nigh half a century may be read in
the life, actions, and adventures of this able, virtuous,
and illustrious man. His chivalrous courage, his
unflinching loyalty, his disinterested patriotism, mark
him out as one of the foremost men of his
noble family, and as one of the finest characters
of his age."<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> In 1692, Lord Sydney, the Lord-Lieutenant,
in his speech from the Throne, was able,
from his former knowledge of the country, to testify
to its vastly increased prosperity.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> "The cause of
this prosperity should," says Hely Hutchinson
"be mentioned. James, the first Duke of Ormonde,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
whose memory should ever be revered by every friend
of Ireland, to heal the wound that this country had
received by the prohibition of the export of her cattle
to England, obtained from Charles II. a letter, dated
the 23rd of March, 1667, by which he directed that
all restraints upon the exportation of commodities of
the growth or manufacture of Ireland to foreign parts
should be taken off, but not to interfere with the
Plantation laws, or the charters to the trading companies,
and that this should be notified to his subjects
of this kingdom, which was accordingly done by a
proclamation from the Lord-Lieutenant and Council;
and at the same time, by his Majesty's permission,
they prohibited the importation from Scotland of
linen, woollen, and other manufactures and commodities,
as drawing large sums of money out of Ireland,
and a great hindrance to manufactures. His grace
successfully executed his schemes of national improvement,
having by his own constant attention, the
exertion of his extensive influence, and the most
princely munificence, greatly advanced the woollen
and revived the linen manufactures."<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Ormonde
established a woollen manufactory at Clonmel, "the
capital of his county palatine of Tipperary, bringing
over five hundred Walloon families from the neighbourhood
of Canterbury to carry it on, and giving
houses and land on long leases with only an acknowledgment
instead of rent from the undertakers. Also
in Kilkenny and Carrick-on-Suir the duke established
large colonies of those industrious foreigners,
so well skilled in the preparation and weaving of
wool."<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>The woollen manufacture was the "true and
natural staple of the Irish, their climate and extensive
sheep-grounds insuring to them a steady and cheap
supply of the raw material, much beyond their home
consumption."<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> It was cultivated for several years
after the Revolution without any interference by the
English Parliament. It had, however, long previously
excited the jealous hatred of English statesmen. "I
am of opinion," says Lord Strafford, writing, when Lord-Lieutenant,
from Ireland to Charles I. in 1634, "that
all wisdom advises to keep this kingdom as much subordinate
and dependent upon England as is possible,
and holding them from the manufacture of wool
(which, unless otherwise directed, I shall by all means
discourage), and then enforcing them to fetch their
clothing from thence, and to take their salt from the
King (being that which preserves and gives value to
all their native staple commodities), how can they depart
from us without nakedness and beggary? Which
is of itself so mighty a consideration that a small
profit should not bear it down."<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> This proposal I
will not characterise. "In 1673, Sir William Temple,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
at the request of the Earl of Essex, then Viceroy of
Ireland, publicly proposed that the manufacture of
woollens (except in the inferior branches) should be
relinquished in Ireland as tending to interfere prejudicially
with the English trade. In all probability
the Irish manufacturers of broadcloths would gain on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
their English rivals, and the improvement of woollen
fabrics in Ireland, argued the statesman, 'would give
so great a damp to the trade of England, that it seems
not fit to be encouraged here.'"<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> These suggestions
were not immediately acted on. In 1660 no doubt
the exportation of Irish woollen goods to England
was prohibited, but this enactment did not at the
time inflict material injury on Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>In 1697 a bill was introduced into the English
House of Commons, forbidding all export from Ireland
of her woollen manufactures. It reached the
House of Lords, but Parliament was dissolved before
it passed its final stage in that assembly.</p>

<p>The destruction of the woollen trade is one of the
most disastrous chapters of Irish history. The circumstances
attending this transaction are detailed in
an Appendix to the "Report from the Select Committee
on the Linen Trade of Ireland," which was
printed on the 6th of June, 1825, by order of the
House of Commons. This paper was prepared by
Lord Oriel, who, as Mr. Foster, was Chancellor of
the Irish Exchequer and afterwards Speaker of the
Irish House of Commons. He was one of the greatest
authorities of his time on trade and finance. The
Report thus describes an incident which is, I believe,
without parallel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>"This export (the woollen) was supposed to interfere,
and very probably did, with the export from
Britain, and a plan was in consequence undertaken
there to annihilate the woollen trade of Ireland, and
to confine us to the linen manufacture in its place.</p>

<p>"Accordingly an Act was passed in England,
1696 (7 &amp; 8 Will., c. 39), for inviting foreign Protestants
to settle in Ireland, as the preamble recites,
and with that view enacting that the imports of all
sorts of hemp and flax, and all the productions thereof,
should from thenceforth be admitted duty free
from Ireland into England, giving a preference by
that exemption from duty to the linen manufacture
of Ireland over the foreign, estimated at the time, as
a report of the Irish House of Commons, on the 11th
February, 1774, states, to be equal to 25 per cent.</p>

<p>"This happened in 1696, and in pursuance of the
foregoing plan both Houses of the English Parliament
addressed King William on the 9th June, 1698.</p>

<p>"The Lords stated in their Address that 'the growing
manufacture of cloth in Ireland, both by the
cheapness of all sorts of necessaries of life, and the
goodness of materials for making all manner of cloth,
doth invite your subjects of England, with their families
and servants, to leave their habitations and settle
there, to the increase of the woollen manufacture in
Ireland, which makes your loyal subjects in this kingdom
very apprehensive that the further growth of it
may greatly prejudice the said manufacture here,
by which the trade of this nation and the value of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
lands will greatly decrease, and the number of your
people be much lessened here; wherefore we humbly
beseech your most Sacred Majesty that your Majesty
would be pleased, in the most public and effectual
way that may be, to declare to all your subjects of
Ireland that the growth and increase of the woollen
manufacture there hath long and will be ever looked
upon with great jealousy by all your subjects of this
kingdom, and if not timely remedied, may occasion
very strict laws totally to prohibit and suppress the
same; and, on the other hand, if they turn their
industry to the settling and improving the <i>linen
manufacture</i>, for which generally the lands are very
proper, <i>they shall receive all the countenance, favour,
and protection from your royal influence for the encouragement
and promotion of the linen manufacture
to all the advantage and profit they can be capable of</i>.'</p>

<p>"The Commons stated their sentiments at the
same time in the following terms: 'We,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> your Majesty's
most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Commons in
Parliament assembled, being very sensible that the
wealth and power of this kingdom do in a great measure
depend on the preservation of the woollen manufacture
as much as possible entire to this realm,
think it becomes us, like our ancestors, to be jealous
of the increase and establishment of it elsewhere,
and to use our utmost endeavours to prevent it.
And, therefore, we cannot without trouble observe
that Ireland, which is dependent on and protected
by England in the enjoyment of all they have, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
which is so proper for the linen manufacture, the
establishment and growth of which there would be
so enriching to themselves, and so profitable to England,
should of late apply itself to the woollen
manufacture, to the great prejudice of the trade of
this kingdom, and so unwillingly promote the linen
trade, which would benefit both themselves and us;
the consequence whereof will necessitate your Parliament
of England to interpose to prevent the mischief
that threatens us, unless your Majesty by your
authority and great wisdom shall find means to
secure the trade of England, by making your subjects
of Ireland to pursue the joint interests of both
kingdoms. And we do most humbly implore your
Majesty's protection and favour in this matter, that
you will make it your royal care, and enjoin all those
you employ in Ireland to make it their care, and use
their utmost diligence, to hinder the exportation of
wool from Ireland except to be imported hither, and
for discouraging the woollen manufacture and encouraging
the linen manufacture of Ireland, <i>to which
we shall always be ready to give our utmost assistance</i>.'</p>

<p>"His Majesty thus replied to the Commons<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>:&mdash;'<i>I
shall do all that in me lies to</i> discourage the woollen
manufacture in Ireland <i>and encourage the linen
manufacture there</i>, and to promote the trade of England.'</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>
<p>"Stronger declarations could not well be made
than in these Addresses and answers, that if the Irish
would come into the compact of giving up their then
great staple of woollens to England, and cultivating
the linens in lieu thereof, they should receive '<i>all the
countenance, favour, and protection for the encouragement
and promotion of their linen manufacture to all
the advantages their kingdom was capable of</i>,' that
the Commons would always be ready to give their
utmost assistance, and his Majesty would do all that
in him lay <i>to encourage the linen manufacture there</i>;
and they had the effect of inducing the Parliament of
Ireland to accede, as will appear from what follows.</p>

<p>"The Lords Justices of Ireland say, in their speech
to the Irish Parliament, the 27th September, 1698:<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
'Amongst those bills there is one for the encouragement
of the linen and hempen manufactures. At our
first meeting we recommended to you that matter,
and we have now endeavoured to render that bill
practicable and useful for that effect, and as such we
now recommend it to you. The settlement of this
manufacture will contribute much to people the
country, and will be found much more advantageous
to this kingdom than the woollen manufacture, which,
being the settled staple trade of England, can never
be encouraged here for that purpose; <i>whereas the
linen and hempen manufactures will not only be encouraged,
as consistent with the trade of England, but
will render the trade of this kingdom both useful and
necessary to England</i>.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Commons replied: 'We pray leave to assure
your Excellencies that we shall heartily endeavour to
establish a linen and hempen manufacture here, and
to render the same useful to England, as well as
advantageous to this kingdom; and we hope to find
such a <i>temperament</i> in respect to the woollen trade
here that the same may not be injurious to England.'<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
In pursuance of this answer they evinced that
<i>temperament</i> most effectually by passing an Act<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> for
laying prohibitory duties on the export of <i>their own</i>
woollen manufacture&mdash;thus accepting the national
compact and fully performing their part of the agreement,
and by that performance giving an incontrovertible
claim to Ireland upon England, and consequently
upon Great Britain, for a perpetual encouragement of
the linen manufacture '<i>to all the advantage and profit
that Ireland should at any time be capable of</i>.'</p>

<p>"It is to be observed that so anxious was England
to confirm and enforce this ratification given by
Ireland, that their Parliament soon after passed a law
affecting to enact what subsequent times have shown
it was incompetent to, and which we therefore here
mention merely to point out the stress which England
laid on the sacrifice made by Ireland of its great and
natural staple trade, in exchange for a new staple
resting on a material not the natural growth of the
country, and the establishment of which was but in
its infancy, though nurtured for near sixty years by
the Government of the kingdom. The Act we refer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
to is the 10 &amp; 11 Will. III., cap. 10, which
recites 'that wool and the woollen manufacture of
cloth, serge, bays, kerseys, and other stuffs made or
mixed with wool, are the greatest and most profitable
commodities of the kingdom, on which the value of
lands and the trade of the nation do chiefly depend;
that great quantities of the <i>like manufactures</i> have of
late been made, and <i>are daily increasing in the
kingdom of Ireland</i>, and in the English Plantations
in America, <i>and are exported from thence to foreign
markets heretofore supplied from England</i>: all which
inevitably tends to injure the value of lands, and to
ruin the trade and woollen manufactures of the
realm; and that for the prevention thereof the export
of wool and of the woollen manufacture from
Ireland be prohibited under the forfeiture of goods
and ship, and a penalty of £500 for every such
offence.'"</p>

<p>Ireland's woollen manufacture was thus sacrificed
to England's commercial jealousy.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> I will give hereafter
some account of the widespread misery this
industrial calamity entailed. It might have been
expected that the solemn compact for the encouragement
of the linen trade would have been scrupulously
observed. This, however, was not the case. The
English Parliament deliberately broke faith with the
Irish people. This charge I will substantiate by
quotations from the speeches of public men in the
English Parliament, the words of the English statute
book, and the admissions of English writers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>Lord Rockingham, speaking in the English House
of Lords on the 11th of May, 1779, "reminded their
lordships of the compact made between both kingdoms
in King William's time, when the Parliament
of Ireland consented to prohibit the export of their
own woollen manufacture, in order to give that of
England a preference, by laying a duty equal to a
full prohibition on every species of woollens, or even
of the raw commodity, and of the solemn assurances
given by both Houses of the British Parliament that
they would give every possible encouragement, and
abstain from every measure which could prevent the
linen manufacture to be rendered the staple of Ireland.
But how had England kept its word? By laying
duties or granting bounties to the linens of British
manufacture equal to a prohibition of the Irish, and
at the same time giving every kind of private and
public encouragement to render Scotland a real
rival to Ireland in almost every species of her linen
fabrics."<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>
<p>"Ireland," says Lord North when Prime Minister
of England, in the speech from which I have previously
quoted, "gave up her woollen trade by compact.
The compact was an exclusive linen trade,
rather a fair competition with England. Ireland, of
her own accord, gave up the woollen trade by an Act
of her own Legislature, which, when it expired, was
made perpetual by an Act of the British Parliament.
But this compact was no sooner made than it
was violated by England, for, instead of prohibiting
foreign linens, duties were laid on and necessarily
collected, so far from amounting to a prohibition on
the import of the Dutch, German, and East Country
linen manufactures, that those manufactures have
been able, after having the duties imposed on them
by the British Parliament, to meet, and in some
instances to undersell, Ireland both in Great Britain
and the West Indies, and several other parts of the
British Empire."<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>Writing in 1778 to the opponents of some trifling
relaxation of the commercial restraints of Ireland,
Edmund Burke asks: "Do they forget that the whole
woollen manufacture of Ireland, the most extensive and
profitable of any, and the natural staple of that kingdom,
has been in a manner so destroyed by restrictive
laws of <i>their own</i>, that in a few years it is probable
they (the Irish) will not be able to wear a coat of their
own fabric? Is this equality? Do gentlemen forget
that the understood faith upon which they were persuaded
to such an unnatural act has not been kept,
and that a linen manufacture has been set up and
highly encouraged against them?"<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>In the year 1750 heavy taxes were laid on the
import to England of sail-cloth made of Irish hemp,
contrary, of course, to the express stipulation of 1698.
An address presented in 1774 to Lord Harcourt, the
Viceroy, by the Irish House of Commons thus describes
the effect of this measure: "They had been
confined by law to the manufacture of flax and
hemp. They had submitted to their condition,
and had manufactured these articles to such good
purpose that at one time they had supplied sails for
the whole British navy. Their English rivals had
now crippled them by laying a disabling duty on
their sail-cloths, in the hope of taking the trade out of
their hands, but they had injured Ireland without
benefiting themselves. The British market was now
supplied from Holland and Germany and Russia,
while to the Empire the result was only the ruin of
Ulster and the flight of the Protestant population to
America."<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>I have dwelt thus at length on the chief commercial
restraints laid on Ireland by the direct legislation
of England. This interference was, however, carried
to almost every branch of Irish trade. To take a few
examples. Lord North in the English Parliament
gives the following account of England's dealings with
the Irish glass trade:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Previous to the 19th Geo. II., Ireland imported
glass from other countries, and at length began to
make some slow progress in the lower branches of
the manufacture itself. By the Act alluded to, however,
the Irish were prohibited from importing any
kind of glass other than the manufacture of Great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Britain, and in section 24 of that Act a most extraordinary
clause was inserted. It not only ordained
that no glass, the manufacture of that kingdom, should
be exported, but it was penned so curiously, and with
so much severe precision, that no glass of the manufacture
of Ireland was to be exported, or so much as
to be laden on any horse or carriage with intent to be
so exported. This was, in his opinion, a very extraordinary
stretch of the legislative power of Great
Britain, considering the smallness of the object. The
Act was much, very much complained of in Ireland,
and apparently with very great justice both as to
principle and effect. It was an article of general use
in Ireland. The manufacturers of glass there, when
thus restrained both as to export and import, could
not pretend to vie with the British; the consequence
of which was that the latter, having the whole trade
to themselves, fixed the price of the commodity as
they liked."<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> By the 9 Anne, c. 12, and 5 Geo. II.,
c. 2, and 7 Geo. II., c. 19, no hops but of British
growth could be imported into Ireland. By the
6 Geo. I., it was enacted that the duty on hops exported
from England should not be drawn back in
favour of Irish consumers.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>Irish cotton manufactures imported to England
were subject to an import duty of twenty-five per
cent., while a statute of Geo. I. enacted penalties on
the wearing of such manufactures in Great Britain
unless they were made there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>The raw material for silk came to Ireland through
England. The original import duty in England was
12d. in the pound, of which 3d. in the pound was retained
there.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>Irish beer and malt, too, were excluded from
England, whereas English beer and malt were imported
into Ireland at a nominal duty. "Hats, gunpowder,
coals, bar-iron, iron-ware, and several other
matters, some of which Ireland had not to export,
and others of which she had very little, were at different
times the objects of English restrictions, whenever
it was fancied that English interests were at all
threatened by them."<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>It was this legislation that caused Edmund Burke
to ask, "Is Ireland united to the Crown of Great
Britain for no other purpose than that we should
counteract the bounty of Providence in her favour,
and in proportion as that bounty has been liberal
that we are to regard it as an evil which is to be
met with in every sort of corrective?"<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>"England," says Mr. Froude, "governed Ireland
for what she deemed her own interest, making her
calculation on the gross balance of her trade ledgers,
and leaving her moral obligations to accumulate, as if
right and wrong had been blotted out of the statute
book of the universe."<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>"One by one of each of our nascent industries,"
observes Lord Dufferin, "was either strangled in its
birth, or handed over gagged and bound to the jealous
custody of the rival interest of England, until at last
every fountain of wealth was hermetically sealed, and
even the traditions of commercial enterprise have
perished through desuetude."</p>

<p>This sketch of English legislation for Irish trade
would leave the impression that the Parliaments of
Great Britain were as lavish in their efforts to suppress
industrial enterprise in that country as any British
trader could reasonably desire. It will surprise us
to find that this atrocious code was not regarded as
sufficiently thorough.</p>

<p>"In the year 1698," says Hely Hutchinson, "two
petitions were preferred from Folkestone and Aldborough,
stating a singular grievance that they suffered
from Ireland 'by the Irish catching herrings
at <i>Waterford and Wexford</i>, and sending them to the
Streights, and thereby <i>forestalling</i> and ruining petitioners'
markets;' but these petitioners had the <i>hard
lot</i> of having motions in their favour rejected."<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

in any estimate of her economical position, and which, although
they do not compensate her for the want of coal, would under proper
application do much to promote her prosperity. Thus Mr. O'Connell,
towards the conclusion of his speech in his own defence, in the State
Trials of 1844, says: "The country is intersected with noble
estuaries. Ships of 500 tons' burthen ride into the heart of the
country, safe from every wind that blows. No country possesses such
advantages for commerce; the machinery of the world might be turned
by the water-power of Ireland. Take the map and dissect it, and you
will find that a good harbour is not more remote from any spot in Ireland
than thirty miles." (R. <i>v.</i> O'Connell, p. 649.) Mr. Chaplin, in the
speech to which I have referred, remarks: "No doubt Ireland does
possess exceptional advantages in water-power which might be turned to
great advantage." (Hansard, 261, Third Series, p. 836.) Ireland is not,
however, absolutely devoid of coal. "Though," says Mr. C. Dawson,
"we make no boast of our mineral treasures, they are, according to
competent authority, well worthy of development. According to Professor
Hull, the Leinster coal-basin contains 118 million tons, only outputting
83,000 tons per annum. In the North, especially in Tyrone,
at Coal Island, there are 17,000 acres of coal-bed (30,000,000 tons),
which the Professor says are by far the most valuable in Ireland. In
the other districts in Ireland there are over 70,000,000 tons. Sir R.
Kane supports the suggestion that borings should be made by the
Government in this district to ascertain if the mineral wealth existed to
the extent computed by Professor Hull, and he adds that when the
panic arose in England about the duration of its coal supply, coal was
looked for then outside the limits of the recognised coal-fields, and
following them down into the Chalk in Kent and other places, of which
Ireland was one." ("The Influence of an Irish Parliament on Irish
Industries," Lecture by Mr. Charles Dawson, <i>Freeman's Journal</i>,
Jan. 5, 1886.)</p></div>

Cooper, i., pp. 185, 186. Miss Cooper comments severely "on the
stolid unconsciousness of wrongdoing by such a design, the undreamed-of
suspicion that such a proposal could be received with any other feeling
than that of approbation." It is but just to the memory of
Strafford to state that he endeavoured to develop the linen manufacture
in Ireland. He sent to Holland for flax seed, and invited
Flemish and French artisans to settle in Ireland. "In order to stimulate
the new industry, the earl himself embarked in it, and expended not
less than £30,000 of his private fortune in the enterprise. It was afterwards
made one of the grounds of his impeachment that he had obstructed
the industry of the country by introducing new and unknown
processes into the manufacture of flax. It was, nevertheless, greatly
to the credit of the earl that he should have endeavoured to improve
the industry of Ireland by introducing the superior processes employed
by foreign artisans, and had he not attempted to turn the improved flax
manufacture to his own advantage by erecting it into a personal
monopoly, he might have been entitled to regard as a genuine benefactor
of Ireland." (Smiles's "Huguenots," p. 126.) Dr. Smiles, in
this passage, speaks of the linen manufacture as a "new industry."
The "Report from the Select Committee on the Linen Trade of Ireland"
states that that trade was "first planted in Ireland by Lord Strafford"
(Appendix, p. 6), and Miss Cooper gives him credit "for the establishment
of the linen manufacture in Ireland." ("Life of Lord Strafford,"
i., p. 346.) These statements are not, I think, historically correct.
Mr. Lecky shows that, although Lord Strafford stimulated the linen
trade, he did not found it. "The linen manufacture may, indeed, be
dimly traced far back into Irish history. It is noticed in an English
poem in the early part of the fifteenth century. A century later
Guicciardini, in his 'Description of the Low Countries,' mentions coarse
linen as among the products imported from Ireland to Antwerp.
Strafford had done much to encourage it, and after the calamities of the
Cromwellian period the Duke of Ormonde had laboured with some
success to revive it." ("England in the Eighteenth Century," ii.,
pp. 211, 212.) See also, for some very valuable remarks on this

states the particulars attending the breach of the Linen
Compact:&mdash;"The main industry of Ireland had been deliberately
destroyed because it had so prospered that English manufacturers
had begun to regard it as a competitor with their own. It is true,
indeed, that a promise was made that the linen and hempen manufacture
should be encouraged as a compensation, but even if it had
been a just principle that a nation should be restricted by force of
law to one or two forms of industry, there was no proportion between
that which was destroyed and that which was to be favoured, and no real
reciprocity established between the two countries." Mr. Lecky having
stated the antiquity of the linen manufacture and its vicissitudes in
Ireland, and having mentioned that "in 1700 the value of the export
of Irish linen amounted to little more than £14,000," thus proceeds:&mdash;"The
English utterly suppressed the existing woollen manufacture in
Ireland in order to reserve that industry entirely to themselves, but the
English and Scotch continued, as usual, their manufacture of linen.
The Irish trade was ruined in 1699, but no legislative encouragement
was given to the Irish linen manufacture till 1705, when, at the urgent
petition of the Irish Parliament, the Irish were allowed to export their
white and brown linens, but these only to the British colonies, and they
were not permitted to bring any colonial goods in return. The Irish
linen manufacture was undoubtedly encouraged by bounties, but not
until 1743, when the country had sunk into a condition of appalling
wretchedness. In spite of the compact of 1698, the hempen manufacture
was so discouraged that it positively ceased. Disabling duties
were imposed on Irish sail-cloth imported into England. Irish checked,
striped, and dyed linens were absolutely excluded from the colonies.
They were virtually excluded from England by the imposition of a duty
of 30 per cent., and Ireland was not allowed to participate in the
bounties granted for the exportation of these descriptions of linen from
Great Britain to foreign countries."&mdash;"Eighteenth Century," vol. ii.,

English Parliament in restraint of Irish trade, I have dealt merely
with legislation of a permanent character. "When," says Hely
Hutchinson, in 1779, "the commercial restraints of Ireland are the
subject, a source of occasional and ruinous restrictions ought not to
be passed over. Since the year 1740 there have been twenty-four
embargoes in Ireland, one of which lasted three years." "Commercial
Restraints," pp. 231, 232. The system of embargoes called forth the
indignation of Arthur Young, the celebrated English traveller. The
prohibition of woollens, etc., was, he says, at least advantageous to
similar manufactures in England, but "in respect to embargoes, even
this shallow pretence is wanting; a whole kingdom is sacrificed and
plundered, not to enrich England, but three or four London contractors."

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III.</h2>

<div class="center">
ENGLISH OPPOSITION TO EFFORTS OF THE IRISH
PARLIAMENT IN FAVOUR OF IRISH TRADE.</div>
</div>

<p>Mr. Fox, speaking in the British House of Commons
on the 17th of May, 1782, as a responsible Minister of
the Crown, thus stated the nature and effect of the
legislation of the English Parliament with reference
to Irish trade: "The power of external legislation
had been employed against Ireland as an instrument
of oppression, to establish an impolitic monopoly in
trade, to enrich one country at the expense of the
other."<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> The English Government was, previously
to the Revolution of 1782, able to dominate the legislation
of the Irish Parliament under the provisions of
Poynings' Law. That power was used to induce the
Irish Parliament to pass laws prejudicial to the
liberties or the commerce of their country, and to
prevent the enactment of laws for the protection of
Irish liberty, and the development of Irish industrial
energies. Thus, when the English Houses of Parliament
addressed William III. on the subject of the
Irish woollen trade, both Lords and Commons
suggested that the King should use his influence to
induce the Irish Parliament to restrain that manufacture,
without rendering English legislation for the
purpose necessary. A few days after these Addresses
were presented, the King wrote to Lord Galway,
one of the Lords Justices of Ireland, as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>
<p>"The chief thing that must be prevented is that
the Irish Parliament take no notice of this here, and
that you make effectual laws for the linen manufacture,
and discourage as far as possible the woollen. It
never was of such importance to have a good session
of Parliament."<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>Ireland was thus, in the words of Mr. Froude,
"invited to apply the knife to her own throat."<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> "The
Irish Houses, in dread of abolition if they refused,
relying on the promise of encouragement to their
linen trade, and otherwise unable to help themselves,
acquiesced."<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> The enactment which they passed was
temporary. Hely Hutchinson says that this law
has every appearance of being framed on the part of
the Administration. The servile body who assented
to it soon had reason to know that to tolerate slavery
is to embrace it. The law did not satisfy the English
Parliament, who passed the perpetual enactment to
which reference has been previously made.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> This is,
however, one of the few instances in which the Irish
Parliament was prevailed on to pass laws in restraint
of their own trade. Even in this case the destruction
of the woollen industry was not considered complete
until English legislation gave it a final blow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>The direct attacks on Irish trade were almost
exclusively the work of the English Parliament;
while the English Privy Council strangled at its birth
every beneficial enactment of the Irish Parliament.</p>

<p>The following instances will explain and illustrate
the difficulties with which the Irish Parliament had to
contend in every effort to promote the material prosperity
of their country:&mdash;</p>

<p>"With," says Mr. Froude, "their shipping destroyed
by the Navigation Act, their woollen manufactures
taken from them, their trade in all its branches
crippled and confined, the single resource left to those
of the Irish who still nourished dreams of improving
their unfortunate country was agriculture. The soil
was at least their own, which needed only to be
drained, cleared of weeds, and manured to produce
grass crops and corn crops as rich as the best in
England. Here was employment for a population
three times more numerous than as yet existed.
Here was a prospect, if not of commercial wealth, yet
of substantial comfort and material abundance."<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>
<p>After some further observations, Mr. Froude thus
proceeds:&mdash;"The tenants were forbidden in their
leases to break or plough the soil. The people no
longer employed were driven away into holes and
corners, and eked out a wretched subsistence by potato
gardens or by keeping starving cattle of their own on
the neglected bogs. Their numbers increased, for
they married early, and they were no longer liable, as
in the old times, to be killed off like dogs in forays.
They grew up in compulsory idleness, encouraged
once more in their inherited dislike of labour,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> and
inured to wretchedness and hunger; and on every
failure of the potato crop, hundreds of thousands were
starving. Of corn very little was grown anywhere in
Ireland. It was imported from England, Holland,
Italy, and France, but in quantities unequal to any
sudden demand. The disgrace of allowing a nation
of human beings to subsist upon such conditions forced
itself at last on the conscience of the Irish Parliament,
and though composed of landowners who were
tempted as much as others to let their farms on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
terms most profitable to them, the House of Commons
in 1716 resolved unanimously to make an effort for a
general change of system, and to reclaim both people
and country by bringing back and stimulating agriculture.
They passed a vote that covenants which
prohibited the breaking soil with the plough were
impolitic, and should have no binding force. They
passed heads of a bill, which they recommended with
the utmost earnestness to the consideration of the
English Council, enjoining that for every hundred
acres which any tenant held he should break up and
cultivate five, and, as a further encouragement, that a
trifling bounty should be granted by the Government
on corn grown for exportation.</p>

<p>"And what did England answer? England
which was so wisely anxious for the prosperity of the
Protestant interest in Ireland: England which was
struggling so pathetically to make the Irish peers and
gentlemen understand the things that belonged to
their peace? The bounty system might or might
not have been well calculated to produce the effect
which Ireland desired. It was the system which
England herself practised with every industry which
she wished to encourage, and it was not on economic
grounds that the Privy Council rejected a Bill which
they ought rather to have thrust of their own accord
on Irish acceptance. The real motive was probably
the same which had led to the suppression of the
manufactures&mdash;the detestable opinion that to govern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Ireland conveniently Ireland must be kept weak.
Although the corn consumed in Ireland had been
for many years imported, the English farmers were
haunted with a terror of being undersold in their own
and foreign markets by a country where labour was
cheap. A motive so iniquitous could not be confessed,
but the objections which the Council were not
ashamed to allege were scarcely less disgraceful to
them. The English manufacturers having secured, as
they supposed, the monopoly of Irish wool on their
own terms, conceived that the whole soil of Ireland
ought to be devoted to growing it. The merchants of
Tiverton and Bideford had recently memorialised the
Crown on the diminution of the number of fleeces
which reached them from the Irish ports. They
attributed the falling off to the contraband trade
between Ireland and France, which shortened their
supplies, enhanced the price, and gave the French
weavers an advantage over them. Their conjecture,
as will be hereafter shown, was perfectly just. The
contraband trade, as had been foreseen when the restrictions
were imposed, had become enormous. But
the Commissioners of the Irish Revenue were unwilling
to confess to carelessness. They pretended that
the Irish farmers, forgetting their obligations to England,
and thinking wickedly only of their own interests,
were diminishing their stock of sheep, breaking
up the soil, and growing wheat and barley. The
allegation, unhappily, was utterly untrue. But the
mere rumour of a rise of industry in Ireland created a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
panic in the commercial circles of England. Although
the change existed as yet only in desire, and the
sheep-farming, with its attending miseries, was increasing
rather than diminishing, Stanhope, Walpole,
Sutherland, and the other advisers of the English
Crown, met the overtures of the Irish Parliament in
a spirit of settled hostility, and, with an infatuation
which now appears insanity, determined to keep
closed the one remaining avenue by which Ireland
could have recovered a gleam of prosperity.</p>

<p>"The heads of the Bill were carried in Ireland
without a serious suspicion that it would be received
unfavourably. A few scornful members dared to say
that England would consent to nothing which would
really benefit Ireland, but they were indignantly
silenced by the friends of the Government. It was
sent over by the Duke of Grafton, with the fullest
expectation that it would be returned. He learnt
first with great surprise that 'the Tillage Bill was
meeting with difficulties.' 'It was a measure,' he
said, 'which the gentlemen of the country had very
much at heart, as the only way left them to improve
their estates while they were under such hard restrictions
in point of trade.' 'It would be unkind,' he
urged, in a second and more pressing letter, 'to refuse
Ireland anything not unreasonable in itself. He conceived
the Corn Bill was not of that nature, and
therefore earnestly requested his Majesty would be
pleased to indulge them in it.'</p>

<p>"Stanhope forwarded in answer a report of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
English Commissioners of Customs, which had the
merit of partial candour. 'Corn,' they said, 'is supposed
to be at so low a rate in Ireland in comparison
with England, that an encouragement to the exportation
of it would prejudice the English trade.'</p>

<p>"The Lords Justices returned the conclusive rejoinder
that for some years past Ireland had imported
large quantities of corn from England, which would
have been impossible had her own corn been cheaper.
'They could not help representing,' they said, 'the
concern they were under to find that verified which
those all along foretold who obstructed the King's
affairs, and which his friends had constantly denied,
that all the marks they had given of duty and
affection would not procure one bill for the benefit of
the nation.'</p>

<p>"The fact of the importation of corn from England
could not be evaded; but the commercial leaders were
possessed with a terror of Irish rivalry which could
not be exorcised. The bill was at last transmitted,
but a clause had been slipped in empowering the
Council to suspend the premiums at their pleasure;
and the House of Commons in disgust refused to take
back a measure which had been mutilated into a
mockery."<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>To take another instance, illustrative of the same
system, which was in full operation sixty years later.
The heads of a bill were introduced in 1771 to prevent
corn from being wasted in making whisky, and to
put some restraint on the vice of drunkenness, which
was increasing. This bill was warmly recommended
to the English Privy Council by Townshend, the Lord-Lieutenant
of the day, who said, "the whisky shops
were ruining the peasantry and the workmen. There
was an earnest and general desire to limit them. It
will be a loss to the revenue, but it is a very popular
bill, and will give general content and satisfaction
throughout the kingdom."<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> "The Whisky Bill,"
says Mr. Froude, "was rejected because the Treasury
could not spare a few thousand pounds which were
levied upon drunkenness."<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>It must also be borne in mind that although the
English Parliament could, and, in fact, did, place
prohibitory duties on Irish goods imported into England,
it was quite impossible for the Irish Parliament
to exercise the same power. Bills of such a nature
would, of course, never obtain the sanction of the
English Privy Council, to whom they must have been
submitted.</p>

<p>The difference between the duties on the same
goods when imported from England into Ireland, and
from Ireland into England, were in some cases striking.
"In Ireland," says Mr. Parsons, speaking in the Irish
Parliament in 1784, "no more than 6d. a yard was
imposed on the importation of English cloths, while
ours in England were charged with a duty of
£2 0s. 6d."<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Pitt, speaking as Prime Minister in the British
House of Commons in February, 1785, stated that on
most of the manufactures of Ireland prohibitory duties
were laid by Great Britain. "They (the Irish) had
not," he said, "admitted our commodities totally free
from duties; they bore, upon an average, about ten per
cent."<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>The helplessness of the Irish Parliament during
this period is demonstrated by Hely Hutchinson.
He states that in 1721, during a period of great distress,
the speech from the Throne, and the Addresses
to the King and the Lord-Lieutenant declare in the
strongest terms the great decay of trade, and the very
low and impoverished state to which the country was
reduced. "But," he says, "it is a melancholy proof
of the desponding state of this kingdom, that no law
whatever was then proposed for encouraging trade or
manufactures, or, to follow the words of the address,
for reviving trade or making us a flourishing people,
unless that for amending laws as to butter and tallow
casks deserves to be so called. And why? Because
it was well understood by both Houses of Parliament
that they had no power to remove those restraints
which prohibited trade and discouraged manufactures,
and that any application for that purpose would at
that time have only offended the people on one side of
the Channel, without bringing any relief to those on
the other."<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>The Irish Parliament did, however, what they
could. Thus, "in the sessions of 1703, 1705, and
1707, the House of Commons resolved unanimously
that it would greatly conduce to the relief of the poor
and the good of the kingdom, that the inhabitants
thereof should use none other but the manufactures of
this kingdom in their apparel, and the furniture of
their houses; and in the last of those sessions, the
members engaged their honours to each other that
they would conform to the said resolution."<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> Many
of their suggestions for the encouragement of home
produce are of extraordinary ingenuity. In 1727, the
Privy Council allowed a bill to become law, entitled
"An Act to encourage the home consumption of wool
by burying in wool only," providing that no person
should be buried "in any stuff or thing other than
what is made of sheep or lambs' wool only."<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> The
custom, now grotesque and unmeaning, but still in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
vogue in Ireland, of wearing scarfs at funerals, was
recommended in the interest of the linen manufacture,
and was first introduced in 1729 at the funeral of Mr.
Conolly, Speaker of the Irish House of Commons.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
So, too, spinning schools were established in every
county, and a board of trustees was appointed to
watch over the interests of the linen manufacture;
"but the utter want of capital, the neglect of the grand
juries, the ignorance, poverty, and degradation of the
inhabitants, made the attempt to create a new manufacture
hopeless."<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>These efforts of the Irish Parliament, though of
little practical effect, demonstrate their keen appreciation
of the sufferings around them and their sympathy
with the wants and wishes of their people, who were
crushed by a system which Mr. Pitt has characterised
as one "of cruel and abominable restraint."<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>
<p>Speaking in the English House of Commons in
1785, that statesman bade members "recollect that from
the Revolution to a period within the memory of every
man who heard him, indeed until these very few years,
the system had been that of debarring Ireland from
the enjoyment and use of her own resources, to make
that kingdom completely subservient to the interests
and opulence of this country, without suffering her to
share in the bounties of nature, in the industries of
her citizens, or making them contribute to the general
interests and strength of the empire."<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>"No country," says Mr. Lecky, "ever exercised a
more complete control over the destinies of another
than did England over those of Ireland, for three-quarters
of a century after the Revolution. No serious
resistance of any kind was attempted. The nation
was as passive as clay in the hands of the potter, and
it is a circumstance of peculiar aggravation that a
large part of the legislation I have recounted was a
distinct violation of a solemn treaty.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> The commercial
legislation which ruined Irish industry, the confiscation
of Irish land which demoralised and impoverished
the nation, were all directly due to the English
Government, and the English Parliament."<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>"If," says Mr. Froude, "the high persons at the
head of the great British Empire had deliberately
considered by what means they could condemn Ireland
to remain the scandal of their rule, they could
have chosen no measures better suited to their end
than those which they pursued unrelentingly through
three-quarters of a century."<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

against the Irish peasantry has frequently been refuted. The accusation
is an old one. Speaking in the Irish House of Commons in
1784, the Right Hon. Luke Gardiner thus repelled it:&mdash;"Those who
render our people idle are the first to ridicule them for that idleness,
and to ridicule them without a cause. National characteristics are
always unjust, as there never was a country that has not produced
both good and bad." "They are general assertions, as false as they are
illiberal. Irishmen have shown spirit and genius in whatever they have
undertaken." "I call upon gentlemen to specify one instance where
the people were indolent when the laws of their country protected
them in their endeavours." ("Irish Debates," iii., p. 127.) "It is a
cant in England," says Mr. O'Connell, "that they (the Irish) are
an idle people, but how can that be said when they are to be found
seeking employment through every part of the world? They are to be
found making roads in Scotland and digging canals in the poisonous
marshes of New Orleans." ("Discussion in Dublin Corporation on
Repeal of the Union," in 1843, p. 58) The <i>Times</i> of the 26th of June,
1845, in an article to which I will refer hereafter, says "The Irishman
is disposed to work."</p></div>

the inability of the Irish Parliament to alleviate the misery of the poor.
"They (the Commons) could not have been insensible of the miseries
of their fellow-creatures, many thousands of whom were lost in those
years, some from absolute want and many from disorders occasioned by
bad provisions. Why was no attempt made for their relief? Because
the Commons knew that the evil was out of their reach, and the poor
were not employed because they were discouraged by restrictive laws
from working up the materials of their own country, and that agriculture
could not be encouraged when the lower classes of the people were
not enabled by their industry to purchase the produce of the farmer's
labour."&mdash;("Commercial Restraints," pp. 47-48.)</p></div>

model of an Act passed by the English Parliament in 1678, providing that
all dead bodies should be wrapped in woollen shrouds. Dean Swift
warmly approved of this measure which, however, he seemed to think
would never pass the Privy Councils. "What," he says, "if we should

<div class="center">
THE IMMEDIATE EFFECTS OF ENGLISH LEGISLATION
ON IRISH TRADE.</div>
</div>

<p>The immediate effects produced upon Ireland by the
commercial policy of Great Britain were such as
might reasonably be anticipated from the brief and
necessarily imperfect account I have given of that
system. The best and most energetic members of
the industrial community sought refuge in exile
from a land where honest labour was robbed by
law of its reward. The weaker ones, who were compelled
to remain, this terrible system defrauded, impoverished,
and degraded. It afflicted every Irishman,
whether at home or abroad, with a sense of
intolerable wrong, and created that passionate resentment
towards England, which has been transmitted
to succeeding generations. "One of the most
obvious consequences," says Mr. Lecky, "was that for
the space of about a century Ireland underwent a
steady process of depletion, most men of energy, ambition,
talent, or character being driven from her
shores."<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> "If the ambition of an Irishman lay in the
paths of manufacture and commerce he was almost
compelled to emigrate, for industrial and commercial
enterprise had been deliberately crushed."<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
legislation, it must be remembered, fell most severely
on the Protestant population of Ireland, although, of
course, it grievously affected every class, and, indeed,
every member of the community. Twenty thousand
Puritans left Ulster on the destruction of the woollen
trade.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> "Until the spell of tyranny was broken, in
1782, annual ship-loads of families poured themselves
out from Belfast and Londonderry. The resentment
they carried with them continued to burn in their new
homes; and, in the War of Independence, England
had no fiercer enemies than the great-grandsons of
the Presbyterians who had held Ulster against Tyrconnel."<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>At the beginning of the eighteenth century, Mr.
Lecky thinks the population of Ireland slightly exceeded
two millions,<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> and he adopts the calculation
of a contemporary writer that the woollen manufacture
at the time of its suppression afforded employment
to 12,000 Protestant families in the metropolis,
and 30,000 dispersed over the rest of the kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>
We can, therefore, see at a glance how large a fraction
of the entire population of the country were directly
deprived of bread by that measure. Swift, whose
deanery lay in the liberties of Dublin, the principal
seat of the woollen manufacture, and who witnessed
the results of its suppression, thus writes:&mdash;"Three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
parts in four of the inhabitants of that district of the
town where I dwell were English manufacturers,
whom either misfortunes in trade, little petty debts
contracted through illness, or the presence of a
numerous family, had driven into our cheap country.
These were employed in working up our worse wool,
while the finest was sent into England. Several of these
had taken the children of the native Irish apprentices
to them who, being humbled by the forfeiture of
upwards of three millions by the Revolution, were
obliged to stoop to a mechanic industry. Upon the
passing of this bill, we were obliged to dismiss thousands
of these people from our service. Those who
had settled their affairs returned home, and overstocked
England with workmen; those whose debts
were unsatisfied, went to France, Spain, and the
Netherlands, where they met with good encouragement,
whereby the natives having got a firm footing
in the trade, being acute fellows, so became as good
workmen as any we have, and supply the foreign
manufacturers with a constant supply of artisans."<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>"Upon the checking the export of our woollen
manufactures," writes Mr. Arthur Dobbs, in 1729,
"and by laying on heavy duties on its being exported
to England in 1699 and 1700, equivalent to a prohibition,
most of those who were embarked in it were laid
under a necessity of removing elsewhere; and, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
piqued at the difficulties they were laid under, many
of the Protestants removed into Germany, and settled
in the Protestant states there, who received them with
open arms. Several Papists at the same time removed
into the northern parts of Spain, where they
laid the foundations of a manufacture highly prejudicial
to England. Many also of the Protestants
who were embarked with Papists in the woollen
manufacture, removed into France, and settled at
Roan and other parts. Notwithstanding Louis XIV.
had repealed the Edict of Nantes, and forced abroad
the French Protestants into different parts of Europe,
yet these were kindly received by him, had great
encouragement given to them, and were protected in
their religion. From these beginnings they have in
many branches so much improved the woollen manufactures
of France, as not only to supply themselves,
but even to vie with the English in the foreign
markets; and by their correspondence they have laid
the foundation for the running of wool thither both
from England and Ireland, highly to the prejudice of
Britain, which pernicious practice is still carried on in
spite of all the care and precaution made use of to
discountenance and prevent it. Thus a check is put
upon the sale of our woollen manufactures abroad,
which would have given employment to all the
industrious poor both of Britain and Ireland,
had not our manufacturers been forced away into
France, Spain, and Germany, where they are now
so improved as in great measure to supply themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
with many sorts they formerly had from
England."<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>In 1773 the Irish House of Commons "had to
hear from the Linen Board that 'many thousands
of the best manufacturers and weavers, with their
families, had gone to seek their bread in America, and
thousands were preparing to follow.' Again a committee
was appointed to inquire. This time the blame
was laid on England, which had broken the linen compact,
given bounties to Lancashire mill-owners, which
Belfast was not allowed to share, and in 'jealousy of
Irish manufactures,' had laid duties on Irish sail-cloth
contrary to express stipulation. The accusation, as
the reader knows, was true."<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> "If," wrote Mr.
Newenham, in 1805, "we said that, during fifty
years of the last century, the average annual emigration
to America and the West Indies amounted to
4,000, and consequently that in that space of time
200,000 had emigrated to the British Plantations, I
am disposed to think we should rather fall short of
than exceed the truth."<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>It would be easy to adduce further evidence of the
extent of this emigration caused by the destruction of
Irish manufactures and its results. The speech, however,
of the Right Hon. Luke Gardiner, delivered in
the Irish House of Commons on the 2nd of April,
1784, is noteworthy. Having described the destruction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
of the woollen trade, which was initiated by the
Irish Act laying it under temporary prohibitions,
passed by "a corrupt majority in this House;" the
consequent emigration of the manufacturers, their
favourable reception in foreign countries, and especially
in France, who, availing herself of their
industry, was enabled, not only "to rival Great
Britain, but to undersell her in every market in
Europe," the speaker proceeded thus&mdash;</p>

<p>"England, from unhappy experience, is convinced
of the pernicious effects of her impolicy. The emigration
of the Irish manufacturers in the reign of
King William is not the only instance that has taught
that nation the ruinous effects of restrictive laws.
Our own remembrance has furnished a sad instance
of the truth of this assertion&mdash;furnished it in the
American war. America was lost by Irish emigrants.
These emigrations are fresh in the recollection of
every gentleman in this House; and when the
unhappy differences took place, I am assured, from
the best authority, that the major part of the American
army was composed of Irish, and that the Irish language
was as commonly spoken in the American
ranks as English. I am also informed it was their
valour determined the conquest; so that England
not only lost a principal protection of her woollen
trade, but also had America detached from her by
force of Irish emigrants."<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>
<p>The weaker and more defenceless members of the
Irish industrial community were forced by circumstances
to remain at home, and were accordingly
exposed to the sufferings entailed by this policy of
unenlightened selfishness and exasperation.</p>

<p>The following extracts, taken from a mass of contemporaneous
documents, will give some idea of their
condition.</p>

<p>"From the time," says Hely Hutchinson, "of this
prohibition [of the woollen manufactures] no Parliament
was held in Ireland till the year 1703. Five
years were suffered to elapse before any opportunity
was given to apply a remedy to the many evils which
such a prohibition must necessarily have occasioned.
The linen trade was then not thoroughly established
in Ireland; the woollen manufacture was the staple
trade, and wool the principal material of that kingdom.
The consequences of the prohibition appear
in the session of 1713. The Commons lay before
Queen Anne a most affecting representation containing,
to use their own words, 'a true state of our
deplorable condition,' protesting that no groundless
discontent was the motive for that application, but a
deep sense of the evil state of their country, and of
the further mischiefs they have reason to fear will
fall upon it if not timely prevented. They set forth
the vast decay and loss of its trade, its being almost
exhausted of coin that they are hindered from earning
their livelihoods, and from maintaining their own manufactures;
that their poor have thereby become very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
numerous; that great numbers of Protestant families
have been constrained to remove out of the kingdom,
as well into Scotland as into the dominions of foreign
princes and states; and that their foreign trade and
its returns are under such restrictions and discouragements
as to be then become in a manner impracticable,
although that kingdom had by its blood and
treasure contributed to secure the plantation trade to
the people of England.</p>

<p>"In a further Address to the Queen, laid before the
Duke of Ormonde, then Lord-Lieutenant, by the
House, with its Speaker, they mention the distressed
condition of that kingdom, and more especially of the
industrious Protestants, by the almost total loss of
trade and decay of their manufactures, and, to preserve
the country from utter ruin, apply for liberty
to export their linen manufactures to the Plantations.</p>

<p>"In a subsequent part of this session the Commons
resolve that, by reason of the great decay
of trade and discouragement of the manufactures of
this kingdom, many poor tradesmen were reduced to
extreme want and beggary. This resolution was agreed
to <i>nem. con.</i>, and the Speaker, Mr. Broderick, then
his Majesty's Solicitor-General, and afterwards Lord
Chancellor, in his speech at the end of the session,
informs the Lord-Lieutenant that 'the representation
of the Commons was, as to the matters contained in it,
the unanimous voice and consent of a very full House,
and that the soft and gentle tones used by the Commons
in laying the distressed condition of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
kingdom before his Majesty, showed that their complaints
proceeded not from querulousness, but from
a necessity of seeking redress.'"<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>In his proposal for the use of Irish manufactures,
which was published in 1720, Dean Swift says: "The
Scripture tells us that oppression makes a wise man
mad, therefore, consequently speaking, the reason
why some men are not mad is because they are not
wise. However, it were to be wished that oppression
would in time teach a little wisdom to fools."<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> "Whoever
travels in this country and observes the face of
nature, and the faces and habits and dwellings of the
natives, will hardly think himself in a land where law,
religion, or common humanity is professed."<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> Nicholson,
an Englishman, translated from the Bishopric of
Carlisle to that of Derry, in a letter to the Archbishop
of Canterbury, written in the same year, gives a similar
account of the prevailing destitution: "Never did I
behold in Picardy, Westphalia, and Scotland, such
dismal marks of hunger and want as appeared in the
countenances of most of the poor creatures I met with
on the road." He states that one of his carriage horses
having been killed by accident, it was surrounded
by "fifty or sixty famished cottagers, struggling
desperately to obtain a morsel of flesh for themselves
and their children."<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Swift, writing in 1727, says:
"The conveniency of ports and harbours, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
nature has bestowed so liberally on this country, is of
no more use to us than a beautiful prospect to a man
shut up in a dungeon."<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> "Ireland is the only kingdom
I ever heard of, either in ancient or modern story,
which was denied the liberty of exporting their native
commodities and manufactures wherever they pleased,
except to countries at war with their own Prince or
State; yet this privilege, by the mere superiority of
power, is refused us in the most momentous parts of
our commerce; besides an Act of Navigation, to
which we never consented, pinned down upon us,
rigorously executed, and a thousand other unexampled
circumstances, as grievous as they are invidious to
mention."<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> "If we do flourish it must be against

the people, the general desolation in most parts of
the kingdom, the old seats of the nobility in ruins,
and no new ones in their stead, the families of
farmers, who pay great rents, living in filth and nastiness,
upon butter-milk and potatoes, without a shoe or
stocking to their feet, or a house so convenient as an
English hogsty to receive them. These, indeed, may
be comfortable sights to an English spectator, who
comes for a short time only to learn the language,
and returns back to his own country whence he finds
all his wealth transmitted.</p>

<p>There is not one argument used to prove the riches
of Ireland which is not a logical demonstration of its
poverty."<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> "Ireland is the poorest of all civilised

<p>"The great scarcity of corn," says Hely Hutchinson,
"had been so universal in this kingdom in the
years 1728 and 1729 as to expose thousands of families
to the utmost necessities, and even to the danger
of famine, many artificers and housekeepers having
been obliged to beg for bread in the streets of
Dublin."<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> This is probably the distress to which
Swift, writing in 1729, alludes: "Our present calamities
are not to be represented. You can have no
notion of them without beholding them. Numbers of
miserable objects crowd our doors, begging us to take
their wares at any price to prevent their families from
immediate starving."<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>"In twenty years," says Mr. Lecky, "there were
at least three or four of absolute famine."<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>The writer of a pamphlet entitled "The Groans of
Ireland in a Letter to a Member of Parliament," published
in Dublin in 1741, thus begins:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have been absent from this country for some
years, and on my return to it last summer found it
the most miserable scene of universal distress that I
ever read of in history.</p>

<p>"Want and misery in every face, the rich unable,
almost as they were unwilling, to relieve the poor;
the roads spread with dead and dying bodies; mankind
of the colour of the docks and nettles which
they fed on; two or three, sometimes more, on a car
going to the grave for want of bearers, to carry them,
and many buried only in the fields and ditches where
they perished. This universal scarcity was ensued by
malignant fevers, which swept off multitudes of all
sorts; whole villages were laid waste by want and
sickness and death in various shapes, and scarce a
house in the whole island escaped from tears and
mourning.</p>

<p>"It were to be wished, Sir, that some curious enquirer
had made a calculation of the numbers lost in
this terrible calamity. If one for every house in the
kingdom died (and that is very probable, when we
consider that whole families and villages were swept
off in many parts together), the loss must have been
upwards of 400,000 souls. If but one for every other
house (and it was certainly more), 200,000 perished&mdash;a
loss too great for this ill-peopled country to bear
and the more grievous as the loss was mostly of the
grown-up part of the working people."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>The writer then proceeds to emphasise the fact to
which Swift had previously directed attention: that
Irish famines are <i>artificial</i>.</p>

<p>"Sir,&mdash;When a stranger travels through this
country and beholds its wide extended and fertile
plains, its great flocks of sheep and black cattle, and
all its natural wealth and conveniences for tillage,
manufactures, and trade, he must be astonished that
such misery and want could possibly be felt by its
inhabitants; but you, who know the Constitution and
are acquainted with its weaknesses, can easily see the
reason."<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>
<p>Writing in the year 1779, Hely Hutchinson says,
"In this and the last year about twenty thousand
manufacturers in this metropolis were reduced to
beggary for want of employment; they were for a
considerable length of time supported by alms; a
part of the contribution came from England, and this
assistance was much wanting, from the general distress
of all ranks of people in this country. Public and
private credit are annihilated."<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> Again, "A country
will sooner recover from the miseries and devastation
occasioned by war, invasion, rebellion, and massacre,
than from laws restraining the commerce, discouraging
the manufactures, fettering the industry, and,
above all, breaking the spirits of the people."<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> He
thus summarises the effects of the eighty years'
restrictive legislation, between the destruction of the
woollen trade in 1699 and 1779, the date at which he
was writing. "Can the history of any other fruitful
country on the globe, enjoying peace for fourscore
years, and not visited by plague or pestilence, produce
so many recorded instances of the poverty and
wretchedness, and of the reiterated want and misery
of the lower orders of the people? There is no such
example in ancient or modern story. If the ineffectual
endeavours by the representatives of those poor
people to give them employment or food had not
left sufficient memorials of their wretchedness, if
their habitations, apparel, and food were not sufficient
proofs, I should appeal to the human countenance
for my voucher, and rest the evidence on that hopeless
despondency that hangs on the brow of unemployed
industry."<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>Such were the more striking effects of this pernicious
legislation. Its remoter consequences were
likewise disastrous. Crime and outrage were promoted
by the suppression of national industry. "In
the year 1762," says Hely Hutchinson, "a new evil
made its appearance, which all the exertions of the
Government and of the Legislature have not since
been able to eradicate. I mean the risings of the
White Boys. They appear in those parts of the
kingdom where manufactures are not established, and
are a proof of the poverty and want of employment
of the lower classes of our people."<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> Then again,
this system divorced law from public opinion. Sir
Henry Maine has well observed, that social necessities
and social opinion are always more or less in advance
of law, and that the greater or less happiness of a
nation depends on the degree of promptitude with
which the gulf between them is narrowed.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> In
Ireland that gulf was deliberately widened; and the
people learned, with good reason, to regard the law,
not as a protector, but as a plunderer of their rightful
gains, and as an agency to make havoc of their
industry. "When England," says Mr. Froude, "in
defence of her monopolies, thought proper to lay
restrictions on the Irish woollen trade, it was foretold
that the inevitable result would be an enormous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
development of smuggling."<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> "The entire nation,
high and low, was enlisted in an organised confederacy
against the law. Distinctions of creed were
obliterated, and resistance to law became a bond of
union between Catholic and Protestant, Irish Celt and
English colonist."<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> Hely Hutchinson, in a paper
laid before Lord Buckinghamshire, in July, 1779, places
this matter in a clear light. "You have forced us
into an illicit commerce, and our very existence
depends now upon it. Ireland has paid Great
Britain for eleven years past double the sum that
she collects from the whole world in all the trade
which Great Britain allows her, a fact not to be
paralleled in the history of the world. Whence did
the money come? But one answer is possible. It
came from the contraband trade, and surely it is
madness to suffer an important part of the empire
to continue in that condition. You defeat your own
objects."<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>Again, this system embittered the relations between
landlord and tenant in Ireland by raising unduly the
creation of farms, the cultivation of the soil being the
only industrial resource left to the people. "Rents,"
says Mr. Lecky, "were regulated by competition; but
it was competition between a half starving population,
who had no other resource except the soil, and were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
prepared to promise anything rather than be deprived
of it.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> The mass of the people," the same writer
continues, "became cottiers, because it was impossible
to gain a livelihood as agricultural labourers or in
mechanical pursuits. This impossibility was due to
the extreme paucity of circulating capital, and may be
chiefly traced to the destruction of Irish manufactures
and to the absence of a considerable class of resident
landlords, who would naturally give employment to
the poor."<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>Such were some of the more immediate effects
upon Ireland of the commercial arrangements of
Great Britain. That system was thus described in
the Irish House of Commons in October, 1779, by
Hussey Burgh, who then held the office of Prime
Serjeant, and afterwards became Lord Chief Baron of
the Court of Exchequer. "The usurped authority of
a foreign Parliament has kept up the most wicked
laws that a jealous, monopolising, ungrateful spirit
could desire, to restrain the bounty of Providence and
enslave a nation whose inhabitants are recorded to be
a brave, loyal, generous people; by the English code
of laws, to answer the most sordid views, they have
been treated with a savage cruelty; the words penalty,
punishment, and Ireland are synonymous; they are
marked in blood on the margin of their statutes, and
though time may have softened the calamities of the
nation, the baneful and destructive influence of those
laws have borne her down to a state of Egyptian
bondage. The English have sowed their laws like
serpents' teeth; they have sprung up as armed men."<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>Few will be disposed to disagree with Mr. Froude
in his estimate of the effects of this policy. "By a
curious combination this system worked the extremity
of mischief, commercially, socially, and politically."<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_108_108" id="Footnote_108_108"></a><a href="#FNanchor_108_108"><span class="label">[108]</span></a> The resemblance between this account of the famine of 1740 and
the account of the condition of Ireland in the June preceding the last
Irish Famine, as given by the <i>Times</i>, is striking. In an article of the
26th June, 1845, that paper says&mdash;"The facts of Irish destitution are
ridiculously simple. They are almost too commonplace to be told.
The people have not enough to eat. They are suffering a real, though
an artificial, famine. Nature does her duty. The land is fruitful enough.
Nor can it be fairly said that man is wanting. The Irishman is disposed
to work. In fact, man and Nature together do produce abundantly.
The island is full and overflowing with human food. But something
ever interposes between the hungry mouth and the ample banquet.
The famished victim of a mysterious sentence stretches out his hand to
the viands which his own industry has placed before his eyes, but no
sooner are they touched than they fly. A perpetual decree of <i>sic vos
non nobis</i> condemns him to toil without enjoyment. Social atrophy
drains off the vital juices of the nation." Mr. Lecky quotes from
"The Groans of Ireland," a copy of which he found in the Halliday
Collection of Pamphlets in the Irish Academy ("Eighteenth Century,"
vol. ii., p. 218). My attention was attracted by the reference, and, on
inquiry, I ascertained that there were several copies of this pamphlet in
the Library of the King's Inns.</p></div>

refrained from referring to the Penal Code. I have confined
myself entirely to a recital of the leading features of the restrictions
imposed by England on Irish trade. It is, in my opinion, impossible to
estimate, in distinct scales, the evils done by these terrible agencies.
They acted and re-acted on each other, and affected not merely the
special objects of legislation, but more or less directly every interest
in the community. The able writer of a pamphlet, "Irish Wool and
Woollens," to which I have frequently referred, says:&mdash;"Possibly the
laws that annihilated the wool trade wrought more destruction than
the legislation that aimed at stamping out the Catholic faith, for the
trade Acts snatched bread from the mouth, filched hope from the
heart, and wrenched power from the hands of the industrial sections of
the community." (p. 43.) From this opinion I am constrained to
differ. Speaking as a Protestant, I have no hesitation in saying that
the injuries inflicted on Ireland by the Penal Code exceeded the injuries
inflicted on her by the trade regulations. "Well," says the Rev.
Canon MacColl, "may Mr. Matthew Arnold speak of that Penal
Code, of which the monstrosity is not half known to Englishmen, and
may be studied by them with profit." ("Arguments For and Against
Home Rule," p. 60.)</p></div></div>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V.</h2>

<div class="center">
THE IRISH VOLUNTEER MOVEMENT AND FREE
TRADE.</div>
</div>

<p>The nature and effects of the Irish Volunteer Movement
have often been stated and explained. I can
only touch upon this movement in a very cursory
manner, confining myself strictly to its bearings on the
commercial arrangements between Great Britain and
Ireland. A very superficial study of Irish history
will show that national movements have a tendency
to grow out of controversies on trade and mercantile
questions. Thus the destruction of the woollen trade
by the English Parliament led Irish politicians to
question the right of that Parliament to legislate for
Ireland at all.  William Molyneux, in his celebrated
"Case of Ireland stated," published in 1698, asks, "Shall
we of this kingdom be denied the birthright of every
free-born English subject by having laws imposed
on us when we are neither personally nor representatively
present?"<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> "That book," says Chief
Justice Whiteside, "met with a fate which it did
not deserve. The English Parliament ordered that
it should be burned, and thereby much increased
the estimation in which it was held in Ireland."<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
Thus, too, the agitation against Wood's half-pence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
a purely commercial topic, assumed insensibly a
national complexion. In his fourth Drapier's letter,
Swift changes the controversy into an examination of
Ireland's political condition. "The remedy," he says,
"is wholly in your own hands, and therefore I have
digressed a little in order to refresh and continue that
spirit so seasonably raised among you, and to let you
see that by the laws of God, of nature, and of nations,
and of your country, you are and ought to be as free
a people as your brethren in England."<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> Swift's
prosecution by the Government of the day and its
failure are well known. Lord Chief Justice Whiteside
thus comments on his public conduct. "Had
there been a few in the Irish Parliament possessed of
the originality, energy, honesty, and capacity of Swift,
the management of political affairs and the true
interests of the country would have been speedily
improved instead of being shamefully neglected.
Swift created a public opinion; Swift inspired hope,
courage, and a spirit of justifiable resistance in the
people; Swift taught Irishmen they had a country to
love, to raise, and to cherish. No man who recalls
the affectionate respect paid by his countrymen to
Swift while he lived, to his memory when dead, can
impute political ingratitude to be amongst the vices
of the Irish people."<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, again, besides actively disputing England's
right to destroy the trade and manufactures of the
country, there was another remedy which lay in the
people's own hands. They could, by the exercise of
self-control, use Irish manufactures alone.</p>

<p>"England," says Mr. Froude, "might lay a veto
on every healthy effort of parliamentary legislation;
but England could not touch the self-made laws
which the conscience and spirit of the nation might
impose upon themselves." Hely Hutchinson has
pointed out, that "the not importing goods from
England is one of the remedies recommended by the
Council of Trade in 1676 for alleviating some distress
that was felt at the time; and Sir William Temple, a
zealous friend to the trade and manufactures of
England, recommends to Lord Essex, then Lord
Lieutenant, to introduce, as far as can be, a vein of
parsimony throughout the country in all things that
are not perfectly the native growths and manufactures.
The people of England cannot reasonably object
to a conduct of which they have given a memorable
example. In 1697 the English House of Lords presented
an Address to King William to discourage the
use and wearing of all sorts of furniture and cloths
not of the growth and manufacture of that kingdom,
and beseech him, by his royal example, effectually to
encourage the use and wearing of all sorts of furniture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
and wearing cloths that are the growth of that kingdom
or manufactured there; and King William
assures them that he would give the example to his
subjects, and would endeavour to make it effectually
followed. The reason assigned by the Lords for
this Address was that the trade of the nation had
suffered by the late long and expensive war. But it
does not appear that there was any pressing necessity
at the time, or that their manufacturers were starving
for want of employment.</p>

<p>"Common sense must discover to every man that
when foreign trade is restrained, discouraged, or prevented
in any country, and where that country has
the materials for manufactures, a fruitful soil, and
numerous inhabitants, the home trade is its best
resource. If this is thought by men of great knowledge
to be the most valuable of all trades, because it
makes the speediest and surest returns, and because
it increases at the same time two capitals in the same
country, there is no nation on the globe whose wealth,
population, strength, and happiness would be promoted
by such a trade in a greater degree than ours."<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>The author of the "Commercial Restraints" was a
barrister of great eminence, who had been Prime
Serjeant, was a member of the Irish Privy Council,
Principal Secretary of State, and Provost of Trinity
College, and a distinguished member of the Irish Parliament.
This book, however, obtained a reception
similar to that accorded to the "Case of Ireland," and
the fourth Drapier's letter. In the fly-leaf of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
copy in the Library of the Honourable Society of
the King's Inns, which I have utilised in arranging
this treatise, there are the following observations:&mdash;"Of
this remarkable book see the <i>Times</i> of February
14, 1846. Extract of a letter of Sir Valentine Blake,
M.P. for Galway, in which he says, 'that immediately
after its publication it was suppressed, and burned by
the common hangman, and that Mr. Flood, in his
place in the House of Commons, said he would give
one thousand pounds for a copy, and that the libraries
of all the three branches of the Legislature could not
procure one copy of this valuable work.'" The
editor of a new edition tells us that there are two
copies of the work in the Library of Trinity College,
Dublin, both of which have been recently obtained,
and from one of them the reprint is taken.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> When
Hely Hutchinson, in 1779, advocated "the necessity
of using our own manufactures," he stated with
accuracy that such arguments, though never so
universal as at that time, were no new idea in Ireland.
It had been recommended half a century before by
Swift, and the celebrated Bishop Berkeley. "I
heard," said Swift, writing in 1720, "the late Archbishop
of Tuam (Dr. John Vesey) make a pleasant
observation that Ireland would never be happy till a

England, except their people and their coals."<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> Again,
in 1727, he says, "The directions to Ireland are very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
short and simple, to encourage agriculture and home
consumption, and utterly discard all importations
that are not absolutely necessary for health or life."<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>
Bishop Berkeley, in the "Querist," published in 1731,
asks these questions, which show clearly his views:&mdash;"Whether
there be upon the earth any Christian or
civilised people so beggarly wretched or destitute as
the common Irish? Whether, nevertheless, there is
any other people whose wants may be more easily
supplied from home?"<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> This advice was acted on by
the Irish people "after fifty years of expectation."
"A great figure," says Chief Justice Whiteside, "now
appears upon the stage of public life&mdash;Henry Grattan,
who took his seat for Charlemont in December,
1775, and began his splendid, though chequered
career. The condition of Ireland at this epoch was
deplorable. Her industry was shackled, her trade
was paralysed, her landed interest was depressed, her
exchequer empty, her pension list enormous, her
shores undefended, her army withdrawn. The policy
and maxims of Swift were revived, a spirit of discontent
and a spirit of independence pervaded the nation;
the colonies had revolted, republican ideas were afloat
in the world, and Ireland was menaced with invasion.
The Government, on being applied to for troops,
declared they had none to spare, and that Ireland
must protect herself. The Volunteer Movement then
commenced, and, to the amazement of ministers, they
soon stood face to face with an armed nation."<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Froude draws this picture of the condition of
Ireland in 1779. "The grand juries represented that
the fields and highways were filled with crowds of
wretched beings half naked and starving. Foreign
markets were closed to them. The home market was
destroyed by internal distress, and the poor artisans
who had supported themselves by weaving were without
work and without food. They had bought English
goods as long as they had the means to buy them.
Now in their time of dire distress they had hoped the
English Parliament would be their friend. They
learnt with pain and surprise that the only boon
which could give them relief was still withheld. They
besought the king to interpose in their favour, and
procure them leave to export and sell at least the
coarse frieze blankets and flannels, which the peasants'
wives and children produced in their cabins. Eloquence
and entreaty were alike in vain. The English
Parliament, though compelled at least to listen to the
truth, could not yet bend itself to act upon it. The
House of Commons still refused to open the woollen
trade in whole or in part, and Ireland, now desperate
and determined, and treading ominously in the steps
of America, adopted the measures which long before
had been recommended by Swift, and resolved to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
exclude from the Irish market every article of British
manufacture which could be produced at home."<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>The Earl of Shelburne, speaking in the British
House of Lords on the 1st of December, 1779, thus
described the attitude of Ireland:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ireland disclaimed any connection with Great
Britain, she instantly put herself in a condition of
defence against her foreign enemies; oppressed at one
time by England, and at length reduced to a state of
calamity and distress experienced by no other country
that ever existed, unless visited by war or famine, and
perceiving that all prospect of justice or relief was in
a manner finally closed, and that she must perish or
work out her own salvation, she united as one man to
rescue herself from that approaching destruction which
seemed to await her. The people instantly armed themselves
and the numbers armed soon increased to upwards
of 40,000 men, and were daily augmenting. This most
formidable body was not composed of mercenaries,
who had little or no interest in the issue, but of the
nobility, gentry, merchants, citizens, and respectable
yeomanry, men able and willing to devote their time
and part of their property to the defence of the whole
and the protection and security of their country.
The Government had been abdicated and the people
resumed the powers vested in it, and in doing so were
fully authorised by every principle of the Constitution,
and every motive of self-preservation, and whenever
they should again delegate their inherent power they
firmly and wisely determined to have it so regulated
and placed upon so large and liberal a basis that they
should not be liable to suffer from the same oppression
in time to come, nor feel the fatal effects and
complicated evils of maladministration, of calamity
without hope of redress, or of iron-handed power
without protection.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>
<p>"To prove that these were the declared and real
sentiments of the whole Irish nation, he should not
dwell upon this or that particular circumstance, upon
the resolutions of country or town meetings, upon the
language of the associations, upon the general prevalent
spirit of all descriptions of men of all religions;
matters of this kind, however true or manifest, were
subject to and might admit of controversy. He would
solely confine himself to a passage contained in a
State paper, he meant the Address of both Houses of
the Irish Parliament, declaring that nothing but the
granting the kingdom a 'free trade' could save it
from certain ruin. Here was the united voice of the
country conveyed through its proper constitutional
organs, both Houses of Parliament, to his Majesty,
against which there was but one dissentient voice in
the Houses, not a second, he believed, in the whole
kingdom. Church of England men and Roman
Catholics, Dissenters, and sections of all denominations,
Whigs and Tories, if any such were to be found
in Ireland, placemen, pensioners, and county gentlemen,
Englishmen by birth, in short, every man in
and out of the House, except the single instance mentioned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
had all united in a single opinion that nothing
would relieve the country short of a free trade."<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>His lordship proceeds to explain the meaning of
the expression "free trade," which was used in a
sense different from the modern acceptation of that
term:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A free trade, he was well persuaded, by no
means imported an equal trade. He had many public
and private reasons to think so. A free trade imported,
in his opinion, an unrestrained trade to every
part of the world, independent of the control, regulation,
or interference of the British Legislature. It was
not a speculative proposition, confined to theory or
mere matter of argument; the people of Ireland had
explained the context, if any ambiguity called for
such an explanation; he received accounts from Ireland
that a trade was opened between the northern
part of Ireland and North America with the privity of
Congress, and indemnification from capture by our
enemies; that provision ships had sailed to the same
place&mdash;nay, more, that Doctor Franklyn, the American
Minister at Paris, had been furnished with full power
to treat with Ireland upon regulations of commerce
and mutual interest and support, and that whether or
not any such treaty should take place, the mutual
interests of both countries, their very near affinity
in blood, and their established intercourse, cemented
farther by the general advantages arising from an
open and unrestrained trade between them, would
necessarily perfect what had already actually begun."<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Lecky thus accurately and distinctly describes
the nature of the commercial arrangements under
which Ireland obtained the limited free trade
which she enjoyed, with some modifications, till the
Union:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The fear of bankruptcy in Ireland; the non-importation
agreements, which were beginning to
tell upon English industries; the threatening aspect
of an armed body, which already counted more than
40,000 men; the determined and unanimous attitude
of the Irish Parliament; the prediction of the
Lord-Lieutenant that all future military grants in
Ireland depended upon his (Lord North's) course;
the danger that England, in the midst of a great
and disastrous war, should be left absolutely without
a friend, all weighed upon his mind; and at the
close of 1779, and in the beginning of 1780, a
series of measures was carried in England which
exceeded the utmost that a few years before the
most sanguine Irishman could have either expected
or demanded. The Acts which prohibited the Irish
from exporting their woollen manufactures and
their glass were wholly repealed, and the great
trade of the colonies was freely thrown open to
them. It was enacted that all goods that might
be legally imported from the British settlements in
America and Africa to Great Britain, may be in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
like manner imported directly from those settlements
into Ireland, and that all goods which may
be legally exported from Great Britain into those
settlements may in like manner be exported from
Ireland, on the sole condition that duties equal to
those in British ports be imposed by the Irish
Parliament on the goods and exports of Ireland.
The Acts which prohibited carrying gold and silver
into Ireland were repealed. The Irish were allowed
to import foreign hops. They were allowed to
become members of the Turkey Company, and to
carry on a direct trade between Ireland and the
Levant Sea.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>"Thus fell to the ground that great system of
commercial restriction which began under Charles II.,
which under William III. acquired a crushing severity,
and which had received several additional clauses in
the succeeding reigns. The measures of Lord North,
though obviously due in a great measure to intimidation
and extreme necessity, were at least largely,
wisely, and generously conceived, and they were the
main sources of whatever material prosperity Ireland
enjoyed during the next twenty years. The English
Parliament had been accustomed to grant a small
bounty&mdash;rising in the best years to £13,000&mdash;on the
importation into England of the plainer kinds of
Irish linen. After the immense concessions made to
Irish trade, no one could have complained if this
bounty had been withdrawn, but North determined to
continue it. He showed that it had been of real use
to the Irish linen manufacture, and he strongly maintained
that the prosperity of Ireland must ultimately
prove a blessing to England."<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>Speaking at the Guildhall in Bristol in 1780,
Edmund Burke thus described the concessions to
Ireland and the series of circumstances to which these
measures owed their origin:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The whole kingdom of Ireland was instantly in
a flame. Threatened by foreigners, and, as they
thought, insulted by England, they resolved at once
to resist the power of France and to cast off yours.
As for us, we were able neither to protect nor to
restrain them. Forty thousand men were raised and
disciplined without commission from the Crown; two
illegal armies were seen with banners displayed
at the same time and in the same country. No
executive magistrate, no judicature in Ireland, would
acknowledge the legality of the army which bore the
King's commission, and no law or appearance of law
authorised the army commissioned by itself. In this
unexampled state of things, which the least error, the
least trespass on our part would have hurried down
the precipice into an abyss of blood and confusion,
the people of Ireland demanded a freedom of trade
with arms in their hands. They interdict all commerce
between the two nations; they deny all new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Supply in the House of Commons, although in time
of war; they stint the trust of the old revenue given
for two years to all the King's predecessors to six
months. The British Parliament, in a former session
frightened into a limited concession by the menaces
of Ireland, frightened out of it by the menaces of
England, were now frightened back again, and made
an universal surrender of all that had been thought
the peculiar, reserved, uncommunicable rights of
England&mdash;the exclusive commerce of America, of
Africa, of the West Indies, all the enumerations of
the Acts of Navigation, all the manufactures&mdash;iron,
glass, even the sacred fleece itself&mdash;all went together.
No reserve, no exception, no debate, no discussion.
A sudden light broke in upon us all. It broke
in, not through well-contrived and well-disposed
windows, but through flaws and breaches, through the
yawning chasms of our ruin. We were taught wisdom
by humiliation. No town in England presumed
to have a prejudice or dared to mutter a petition.
What was worse, the whole Parliament of England,
which retained authority for nothing but surrenders,
was despoiled of every shadow of its superintendence.
It was, without any qualification, denied in theory as
it had been trampled upon in practice."<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>"The chain," says Mr. Froude, "was allowed to
remain till it was broken by the revolt of the
American colonies, and Ireland was to learn the
deadly lesson that her real wrongs would receive
attention only when England was compelled to remember
them through fear."<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>The commercial privileges thus obtained would
have been practically valueless unless accompanied
with legislative independence. I have explained the
system by which measures proposed by the Irish
Parliament were robbed of their efficiency by the
action of the English and Irish Privy Councils. "To
prevent," says Mr. Froude, "the Irish Parliament from
being troublesome, it was chained by Poynings' Act;
and when the Parliament was recalcitrant, laws were
passed by England over its head." At this time the
English Privy Council actively exercised its influence
on the commercial legislation of the Irish Parliament.
"The business of sugar-refining had recently taken
great head in Ireland, and the Irish Parliament sought
to defend it against the English monopoly by an
import duty on refined sugar; while they sought to
give it a fair stimulus by admitting raw sugar at a
low rate. This the Privy Council reversed, reducing
the duty on refined sugar 20 per cent. under the drawback
allowed in England to the English refiner on
export, and thereby giving the latter a virtual premium
to that amount, and also increasing the duty
on the raw sugar. The time was ill-chosen for further
invasions on Irish rights."<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> "Several minor circumstances
concurred to exasperate the Irish people still
further, and to render irrevocable and, soon after,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
irresistible, their determination to have a free Parliament,
without which they said they never could
obtain the extension of their trade amongst other
benefits sought, nor even be sure of preserving what
had been conceded to them."<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> Chief Justice Whiteside
has given, in a few words, this spirited and
accurate description of the attainment of Irish legislative
independence&mdash;"Down went Poynings' Law,
useful in its day; down went the Act of Philip and
Mary; down went the obnoxious statute of George I.;
the Mutiny Bill was limited; restrictions on Irish
trade vanished; the ports were opened; the Judges
were made irremovable and independent. I cannot
join in the usual exultation at the proceedings of the
volunteers; on the contrary, I regret their occurrence.
Not that I think the resolutions carried at Dungannon
were in themselves unjust; not that I would hesitate
to claim for Ireland all the rights possessed by our
English fellow-subjects; but because all these inestimable
advantages were not granted by the wisdom
of the Government, through the recognised channel of
Parliament, and were carried at the point of the
bayonet. The precedent was dangerous. Had Walpole
been alive he would have repented his blunder
in listening to Primate Boulter, and refusing to be
advised by the counsels of Swift. But the deed was
done."<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> On the 16th of April, 1782, in the Irish House
of Commons, Grattan thus expressed his high-wrought
enthusiasm:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>"I found Ireland on her knees. I watched over
her with an eternal solicitude. I have traced her
progress from injuries to arms, and from arms to
liberty. Spirit of Swift, spirit of Molyneux, your
genius has prevailed. Ireland is now a nation. In
that new character I hail her, and bowing in her
august presence, I say, Esto Perpetua."<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<div class="center">

THE COMMERCIAL ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN
ENGLAND AND IRELAND, 1782-1800.</div>
</div>

<p>The commercial relations between England and
Ireland in the interval between 1782 and 1800 should
be clearly understood.</p>

<p>Ireland had, by the Acts of 1779 and 1780,
obtained the freedom of foreign and colonial trade,
both of export and of import.</p>

<p>By an Act of 1793, she had obtained liberty to
re-export foreign and colonial goods from her own
shores to England.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>She had, by an English Act of the same year, got
the illusory privilege of having an eight-hundred-ton
East Indiaman to make up a cargo for the East in
her ports. But she had not free trade to the East,
nor had she the admission to English ports for
her goods.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> "The practical boon," says Mr. Butt,
"that was won for the Irish nation (by the Volunteers),
was the right of the Parliament of Ireland
to control our own harbours, and to regulate our
own trade. Of course the trade of Ireland was
subject to the interference which England could
exercise by her dominion over the colonies and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
dependencies of the Imperial Crown. A law which
would have prohibited the exportation of Irish goods
either to England or France or Canada, would have
been beyond the power of the English Parliament to
pass, but it was perfectly competent to that Parliament
to prohibit the importation of these goods into
England or Canada, just in the same manner as the
French Government might have prohibited their
importation into France. The English Parliament
was the supreme legislature for England and the
colonies, and had just the same power of legislating
against the importation of Irish products, as they
would have had against those of Holland or of
France."</p>

<p>Thus stood the Irish Parliament in constitutional
position from 1782 until its dissolution.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>England, as we have seen, had laid prohibitory
duties on Irish manufactures, whereas Ireland, bound
by the chain of Poynings' Law, was unable to protect
her own industries. "It was very natural," in the
words of Mr. Pitt, "that Ireland, with an independent
legislature, should now look for perfect equality."</p>

<p>In 1783 Mr. Griffiths, advocating in the Irish House
of Commons the protection of Irish manufacturers,
said: "Lord North knew very well when he granted
you a free trade that he gave you nothing, or, at most,
a useless bauble, and when petitions were delivered
against our free trade by several manufacturing towns
in England, he assured them in circular letters that
nothing effectual had or should be granted to Ireland."<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>The Irish Parliament, however, on obtaining legislative
independence, refrained from measures of retaliation
in the hope that the commercial relations of
both countries would be settled on a satisfactory basis.</p>

<p>Mr. Pitt, in introducing in the English House of
Commons his celebrated Commercial Propositions for
the regulation of trade between England and Ireland,
thus speaks: "To this moment (February, 1785) no
change had taken place in the intercourse between
Great Britain and Ireland themselves. Some trivial
points, indeed, had been changed, but no considerable
changes had taken place in our manufactures exported
to Ireland, or in theirs imported to England. That,
therefore, which had been done was still believed by
the people of Ireland to be insufficient, and clamours
were excited and suggestions published in Dublin
and elsewhere of putting duties on our products and
manufactures under the name of protecting duties."<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>Chief Justice Whiteside thus states summarily the
scope of Mr. Pitt's propositions:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was proposed to allow the importation of the
produce of all other countries through Great Britain
into Ireland, or through Ireland into Great Britain,
without any increase of duty on that account. It
was proposed, as to any article produced or manufactured
in Ireland or in England, where the duties
were then different on importation into either country,
to reduce those duties in the kingdom where they
were highest down to the lower scale. And it was
asked from Ireland that when the gross hereditary
revenue should rise above a fixed sum, the surplus
should be appropriated towards the support of the
naval force of the Empire. These propositions passed
through both branches of the Irish Legislature, were
remitted to England, and by Pitt laid before the
British House of Commons. He was immediately
attacked by Fox and the Whigs, aided by Lord
North, who one and all declared themselves the uncompromising
enemies of free trade. And these factious
men declared that in the interests of the British
manufacturers they could not allow Irish fustians to
be brought into England to ruin English manufacturers.
The fustian they affected to fear was nothing
to be compared with the fustian of their speeches.
The enlightened views of the great Conservative
minister were in a measure baffled by the shameful
opposition of Fox, and of his friends in Parliament,
and of thick-headed cotton manufacturers out of the
House. The result was that Pitt was coerced to introduce
exceptions and limitations. The eleven propositions
grew up to twenty, the additional propositions
relating to various subjects, patents, copyrights,
fisheries, colonial produce, navigation laws, the enactment
as to which was that whatever navigation laws
were then, or should thereafter be enacted by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
Legislature of Great Britain, should also be enacted
by the Legislature of Ireland; and in favour of the
old East India Company monopoly, Ireland was debarred
from all trade beyond the Cape of Good Hope
to the Straits of Magellan." "There seemed to be
nothing hurtful to the pride of Ireland in the affair.
But when Fox found that his great rival defeated
him on the commercial part of the question, he artfully,
as Lord Stanhope shows, changed his ground
of attack, and availing himself of the limitations
which Pitt had been compelled to introduce into his
original scheme, Fox cried out that this was a breach
of Ireland's newly-granted independence. 'I will
not,' said Fox, with incredible hypocrisy, or with incredible
folly, 'I will not barter English commerce for
Irish slavery, this is not the price I would pay, nor
is this the thing I would purchase.'" "When the
twenty propositions of Mr. Pitt were returned to the
Irish Parliament, they encountered a fierce and protracted
opposition. Mr. Grattan's speech has been
extolled as one of his ablest&mdash;it is not intemperate.
His chief objection was to the fourth resolution, by
which he said, 'We are to agree to subscribe whatever
laws the Parliament (of England) shall subscribe
respecting navigation; we are to have no legislative
power&mdash;then there is an end of your free trade and
of your free Constitution.' He also curiously objected
that the measure was 'an union&mdash;an incipient
and a creeping union&mdash;a virtual union establishing
one will in the general concerns of commerce and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
navigation, and reposing that will in the Parliament
of Great Britain.'" "Dublin was illuminated, the
people exulted in the abandonment of the scheme."<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>"It was not," says Mr. John O'Connell, "till after
a fair experiment and delay that the Irish Parliament,
despairing of getting England to terms by fair means,
commenced retaliation. To this we have the incontestable
testimony of the Commissioners of Revenue
Inquiry in 1822, an authority by no means disposed
to be over-favourable to Irish interests or over-anxious
for the credit of the Irish Parliament. In their
fourth report, speaking of the system of restrictions
on English goods and bounties on their own, to
which that Parliament had recourse, they say:</p>

<p>"Ireland was undoubtedly instigated to the adoption
of this course by the exclusive spirit of the commercial
policy of England. It will be found that
few exceptions in favour of the sister kingdom were
inserted in the list of goods absolutely prohibited to
be imported into this country (England), in which
list all goods made of cotton-wool, every description
of manufactured woollen, silk, and leather, together
with cattle, sheep, malt, stuffs, and other less important
articles were at one time comprehended. In
this embarrassing situation of exclusion from the
markets of Great Britain, and deriving little assistance
from foreign trade, Ireland had no other course to
pursue for the protection of her own industry except
that of maintaining, by restrictive duties on the
importations from Great Britain, the manufacturing
means she possessed for the supply of her own
markets."<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>That Ireland made a great advance in prosperity
in the interval between 1782 and 1800 is in my
judgment incontrovertible.</p>

<p>Mr. O'Connell, when conducting his own defence
in the State Trials of 1844, thus spoke with reference
to this subject:</p>

<p>"I may be asked whether I have proved that the
prophecy of Fox was realised&mdash;that the prosperity
that was promised to Ireland was actually gained by
reason of her legislative independence. Now, pray,
listen to me; I shall tell you the evidence by which I
shall demonstrate this fact. It is curious that the
first of them is from Mr. Pitt, again in the speech he
made in 1799 in favour of the resolutions for carrying
the Union. If he could have shown that Ireland was
in distress and destitution, that her commerce was
lessened, that her manufactures were diminished,
that she was in a state of suffering and want
by reason of, or during the legislative independence
of the country, of course he would have made
it his topic in support of his case, to show that a
separate Legislature had worked badly, and produced
calamities and not blessings; but the fact was too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
powerful for him. He had ingenuity to avail himself
of the fact, which fact he admitted; and let us see how
he admitted it. He admitted the prosperity of Ireland,
and here was his reasoning. Now, mark it. 'As
Ireland,' he said, 'was so prosperous under her own
Parliament, we can calculate that the amount of her
prosperity will be trebled under a British Legislature.'
He first quoted a speech of Mr. Foster's in 1785, in
these words:&mdash;'The exportation of Irish produce to
England amounts to two millions and a half annually,
and the exportation of British produce to Ireland
amounts to one million.' Instead of saying, 'You are
in want and destitution; unite with England, and you
will be prosperous,' he was driven to admit this:
'Ireland is prosperous now with her own Parliament,
but it will be trebly prosperous when you give up that
Parliament, or have it joined with the Parliament of
England.' So absurd a proposition was never yet
uttered; but it shows how completely forced he was to
admit Irish prosperity, when no other argument was
left in his power; but the absurd observation I have
read to you. He gives another quotation from Foster,
in which it is said Britain imports annually £2,500,000
of our products, all, or nearly all, duty free, and we
import a million of hers, and raise a revenue on almost
every article of it. This relates to the year 1785.
Pitt goes on to say: 'But how stands the case now
(1799)? The trade at this time is infinitely more
advantageous to Ireland. It will be proved from
the documents I hold in my hand&mdash;as far as relates to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
the mere interchange of manufactures&mdash;that the manufactures
exported to Ireland from Great Britain in
1797 very little exceeded one million sterling (the
articles of produce amount to nearly the same sum);
whilst Great Britain, on the other hand, imported from
Ireland to the amount of more than three millions in
the manufacture of linen and linen-yarn, and between
two and three millions in provisions and cattle, besides
corn and other articles of produce.' 'That,' said Mr.
Pitt, 'was in 1785, three years after her legislative
independence; that was the state of Ireland.' You
have seen, gentlemen, that picture. You have heard
that description. You have heard that proof of the
prosperity of Ireland. She then imported little more
than one million's worth of English manufacture; she
exported two and a half millions of linen and linen-yarn,
adding to that the million of other exports.
There is a picture given of her internal prosperity.
Recollect that we now (1844) import largely
English manufactures, and that the greatest part
of the price of these manufactures consists of
wages which the manufacturer gives to the
persons who manufacture them. £2,500,000 worth
of linen and linen-yarn were exported, and one
million of other goods. Compare that with the
present state of things. Does not every one of you
know there is scarcely anything now manufactured
in Ireland, that nearly all the manufactures used in
Ireland are imported from England? I am now
showing the state of Irish prosperity at the time I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
am talking of. I gave you the authority of Foster
(no small one) and of Pitt for Irish prosperity during
that time. I will give you the authority of another
man that was not very friendly to the people of
this country&mdash;that of Lord Clare. Lord Clare made
a speech in 1798, which he subsequently published,
and in which I find this remarkable passage, to
which I beg leave to direct your particular attention.
'There is not,' said his lordship, 'a nation on
the face of the habitable globe which has advanced
in cultivation, in manufactures, with the same rapidity
in the same period as Ireland' (namely, from 1782 to
1798). That was the way in which Irish legislative
independence worked, and I have in support of it the
evidence of Pitt, Foster, and Lord Clare; and Lord
Grey, in 1799, talking of Scotland in the same years,
says: 'In truth, for a period of more than forty years
after the [Scottish] Union, Scotland exhibited no
proofs of increased industry and rising wealth.' Lord
Grey, in continuation, stated that 'till after 1748
there was no sensible advance of the commerce of
Scotland. Several of her manufactures were not
established till sixty years after the Union, and her
principal branch of manufacture was not set up, I
believe, till 1781. The abolition of the heritable
jurisdictions was the first great measure that gave
an impulse to the spirit of improvement in Scotland.
Since that time the prosperity of Scotland has
been considerable, but certainly not so great as
that of Ireland has been within the same period.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Lord Plunket, in his speech in 1799, in one of his
happiest efforts of oratory, speaks of her as of 'a
little island, with a population of four or five millions
of people, hardy, gallant, and enthusiastic, possessed
of all the means of civilisation, agriculture, and
commerce well pursued and understood, a Constitution
fully recognised and established, her revenues,
her trade, her manufactures thriving beyond her
hope, or the example of any other country of her
extent, within these few years advancing with a
rapidity astonishing even to herself, not complaining
of deficiency in these respects, but enjoying and
acknowledging her prosperity.'</p>

<p>"Gentlemen of the Jury, I will now direct your attention
to such documents as will tend to corroborate
the facts contained in those I have already adverted
to. You have heard that in 1810 a meeting was held
in Dublin to petition the Legislature for a Repeal of
the Union. I will read an unconnected passage from
a speech delivered by a gentleman belonging to a
most respectable house in this city.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> It is as follows:&mdash;'Some
of us remember this country before we recovered
and brought back our Constitution in the
year 1782. We are reminded of it by the present
period. Then as now our merchants were without
trade, our shopkeepers without customers, our workmen
without employment; then as now it became
the universal feeling that nothing but the recovery of
our rights could save us. Our rights were recovered,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
and how soon afterwards, as if by magic, plenty smiled
on us, and we soon became prosperous and happy.'
Let me next adduce the testimony of a class of citizens
who, from their position and the nature of their avocations,
were well calculated to supply important
evidence on the state of Ireland subsequent to the
glorious achievements of 1782. The bankers of
Dublin held a meeting on the 18th of December,
1798, at which they passed the following resolutions:&mdash;'Resolved,
that since the renunciation of the power
of Great Britain in 1782 to legislate for Ireland, the
commerce and prosperity of this kingdom have eminently
increased,' 'Resolved, that we attribute these
blessings, under Providence, to the wisdom of the
Irish Parliament.' The Guild of Merchants met on
the 14th January, 1799, and passed a resolution declaring
'That the commerce of Ireland has increased,
and her manufactures improved beyond example, since
the independence of this kingdom was restored by
the exertions of our countrymen in 1782. Resolved,
that we look with abhorrence on any attempt to deprive
the people of Ireland of their Parliament, and
thereby of their constitutional right and immediate
power to legislate for themselves.' I have given
abundance of proofs, from extracts I have read, of
the prosperity of Ireland under the fostering care of
her own Parliament. A Parliamentary document
shows that, from 1785 to the period of the Union, the
increase in the consumption of teas in Ireland was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
84 per cent., while it was only 45 per cent. in England.
The increase of tobacco in Ireland was 100 per
cent., in England 64; in wine, in Ireland 74 per cent.,
in England 52; in sugar, 57 per cent. in Ireland, and
in England 53; in coffee, in Ireland 600 per cent., in
England 75. You have this proof of the growing
prosperity of Ireland from the most incontestable
evidence. No country ever so rapidly improved as
Ireland did in that period."<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<div class="center">
THE COMMERCIAL ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN ENGLAND
AND IRELAND EFFECTED BY THE ACT OF
LEGISLATIVE UNION.</div>
</div>

<p>The commercial arrangements effected between England
and Ireland at the time of the Union are embodied
in the sixth article of the Act of Union. This
article provides that in respect of trade and navigation
the subjects of Great Britain and Ireland are to
be on the same footing from the 1st of January, 1801;
that there are to be no duties or bounties on the exportation
of produce of one country to the other; that
all articles (except certain specified articles scheduled,
which were to be subject to certain countervailing
duties) the produce of either country are to be imported
free from duty; that articles enumerated in
Schedule II. are to be subject for twenty years to the
duties therein mentioned; that the woollen manufacturers
are to pay on importation into each country
from the other the duties now payable on importation
into Ireland; that the duties on salt, hops, and wools
are not to exceed the duties that were then paid on
importation into Ireland; that the duties on calicoes
and muslins are to be liable to the duties then payable
on these commodities on importation from Great
Britain to Ireland till the 5th of January, 1808; that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
after that date these duties are to be reduced to 10
per cent. till January 5th, 1821, and then to cease
altogether; that duties on cotton-yarn and cotton-twist
are to be liable to the duties then payable on
these commodities<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> till January 5th, 1808; that
these duties are to be reduced annually from that
date, and on the 5th of January, 1816, to cease altogether;
that the produce of either country, subject to
internal duty, is, on importation into each country, to
be subject to countervailing duty; that the produce
of either country exported through the other is to be
subject to the same charges as if it had been exported
directly from the country producing it; that duties
charged on the import of foreign or colonial produce
into either country are, on their export to the other,
to be drawn back so long as the expenditure of the
United Kingdom shall be defrayed by proportional
contributions, but that this provision is not to extend
to duties on corn.</p>

<p>The Speaker of the Irish Commons&mdash;the Right
Hon. John Foster (afterwards Lord Oriel)&mdash;was the
chief among several able opponents of these regulations.
In 1799 and in 1800 he made powerful
speeches in opposition, and went largely into the
subject of the commercial relations of the two
countries, and exposed their past and future inequalities
and injustices towards Irish interests. His
objections to the 6th Article of Union were, briefly,
as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>
<p>"That they lowered all protecting duties that were
above 10 per cent. to that amount, and thus exposed
the infant manufactures of Ireland (which the Irish
Parliament had in latter years begun to protect) to the
overwhelming competition of the great capital and
long-established skill and ability of England. That
no less than seventy articles of our manufacture would
thus be injured, and our cotton manufactures in particular,
in which we had begun to make most promising
advances, would be nearly ruined. That no preference
over foreign goods in the British market was
given. That the 'new and excessive' duties on salt
were made perpetual, those on hops and coals unalterable.
That our brewery was left unprotected, etc., etc."</p>

<p>The opponents of the Union drew up a solemn
and elaborate protest in order to perpetuate on the
records of Parliament, and hand down to posterity,
their views on that subject. Lord Corry moved the
Protest and Address to the King, which thus speaks
of the commercial arrangements proposed and subsequently
carried out under the provisions of the Act
of Union: "Were all the advantages which without
any foundation they have declared that this measure
offers, to be its instant and immediate consequence,
we do not hesitate to say expressly that we could not
harbour the thought of accepting them in exchange
for our Parliament, or that we could or would barter
our freedom for commerce, or our constitution for
revenue; but the offers are mere impositions, and we
state with the firmest confidence that in commerce or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
trade their measure confirms no one advantage, nor
can it confirm any, for by your Majesty's gracious
and paternal attention to this your ancient realm of
Ireland, every restriction under which its commerce
laboured has been removed during your Majesty's
auspicious reign, and we are now as free to trade to
all the world as Britain is. In manufactures, any
attempt it makes to offer any benefit which we do not
now enjoy is vain and delusive, and whenever it is to
have effect, that effect will be to our injury. Most of
the duties on imports which operate as protections to
our manufactures, are under its provisions either to be
removed or reduced immediately, and those which
will be reduced are to cease entirely at a limited
time, though many of our manufacturers owe their
existence to the protection of those duties, and
though it is not in the power of human wisdom to
foresee any precise time when they may be able to
thrive without them. Your Majesty's faithful Commons
feel more than an ordinary interest in laying
this fact before you, because they have under your
Majesty's approbation raised up and nursed many of
those manufactures, and by so doing have encouraged
much capital to be vested in them, the proprietors of
which are now to be left unprotected, and to be
deprived of the Parliament on whose faith they
embarked themselves, their families, and properties in
the undertaking."<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>
<p>Mr. Pitt could not have been ignorant of the effect
which English competition would produce on the
infant and practically unprotected manufactures of
Ireland. Thus fifteen years previously, when introducing
his Commercial Propositions of 1785 in the
English House of Commons, he calmed the fears
and raised the hopes of the English manufacturers:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It was said that our manufactures were all
loaded with heavy taxes. It was certainly true, but
with that disadvantage they had always been able to
triumph over the Irish in their own markets, paying
an additional ten per cent. on the importation to
Ireland, and all the charges. But the low price of
labour was mentioned. Would that enable them to
undersell us? Manufacturers thought otherwise&mdash;there
were great obstacles to the planting of any
manufacture. It would require time for arts and
capital, and the capital would not increase without
the demand also, and in an established manufacture
improvement was so rapid as to bid defiance to rivalship."<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>The Irish Parliament, in wishing to protect their
infant manufactures, were strictly within the lines of
modern economic science. Thus Mr. John Stuart
Mill speaks of the wisdom of protecting duties in
countries whose conditions are similar to those of
Ireland as described by Mr. Pitt:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>
<p>"The only case in which, on mere principles of
political economy, protecting duties can be defensible,
is when they are imposed temporarily (especially in a
young and rising nation) in the hopes of naturalising
a foreign industry in itself perfectly suitable to the
circumstances of the country. The superiority of one
country over another in a branch of production often
arises only from having begun it sooner. There may
be no inherent advantage on one part or disadvantage
on the other, but only a present superiority of
acquired skill and experience. A country which has
this skill and experience yet to acquire may in other
respects be better adapted to the production than
those that were earlier in the field; and, besides, it is
a just remark of Mr. Rae that nothing has a greater
tendency to promote improvements in any branch of
production than its trial under a new set of conditions.
But it cannot be expected that individuals
should at their own risk, or rather to their certain
loss, introduce a new manufacture and bear the
burthen of carrying it on until the producers have
been educated up to the level of those with whom the
processes are traditional. A protecting duty continued
for a reasonable time will sometimes be the
least inconvenient mode in which the nation can tax
itself for the support of such an experiment. But the
protection should be confined to cases in which there
is good ground of assurance that the industry which
it fosters will, after a time, be able to dispense with
it, nor should the domestic producers ever be allowed
to expect that it will be continued to them beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
the time necessary for a fair trial of what they are
capable of accomplishing."<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>The Irish manufactures, which had revived by the
protecting care of the Irish Parliament, died when
that safeguard was removed.</p>

<p>Mr. Bushe, who was eighteen years Solicitor-General
under a Tory Administration, and twenty
years Chief Justice of Ireland, thus briefly described
in the Irish Parliament the course of policy pursued
by England towards the "sister country":&mdash;</p>

<p>"For centuries have the British nation and Parliament
kept you down, shackled your commerce,
paralysed your exertions, despised your character,
and ridiculed your pretensions to any privileges, commercial
or constitutional."<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>"I cannot think," says Mr. Chaplin, from his place
in the English House of Commons, "that any reforms
or remedial legislation that may be adopted (for Ireland)
can be considered satisfactory or complete
which do not include encouragement and, if necessary,
assistance for the re-establishment of those industries
which in former days were destroyed by the bitterly
unjust and selfish policy of England."<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>"<i>It contains, I think, within a wonderfully narrow compass,
the heart and pith of a large as well as sad chapter of
history.</i>"&mdash;<span class="smcap">Rt. Hon. W. E. Gladstone</span>, M.P.</p>

<p>"Mr. Swift MacNeill explains the constitution of the Irish Parliament,
both before 1782 and&mdash;what has been called Grattan's
Parliament&mdash;after 1782, and shows the differences and relations between
it and the English Parliament; and he offers such an account of the
working of the system&mdash;impartial in spirit and supported by abundant
quotations from contemporary public men, both Irish and English&mdash;as
is fitted to warn us against its revival, at least without serious modifications."&mdash;<i>Contemporary
Review.</i></p>

<p>"The history of the national Parliamentary government of Ireland
is but vaguely known, and it is important just now that information
respecting it should be accessible in a popular form. This work puts
the subject into a nutshell."&mdash;<i>Literary World.</i></p>

<p>"We have never seen the workings of the old Irish Parliament
placed before the reader in so accessible a form as in this volume, for
which both Mr. MacNeill and Messrs. Cassell &amp; Co., who are the
publishers, deserve the best thanks of every reader."&mdash;<i>Liverpool
Mercury.</i></p>

<p>"The book has a value which it would not be easy to overrate, and
should find its way into the hands of every politician."&mdash;<i>Plymouth
Western Daily Mercury.</i></p>

<p>"A little book of exceeding value."&mdash;<i>Londonderry Journal.</i></p>

<p>"This concise but clear and comprehensive treatise from the pen of
Mr. J. G. Swift MacNeill, M.A., is issued at a peculiarly appropriate
time, and will from that circumstance, no less than from its own merits,
be gratefully welcomed by those who are anxious for light and leading
on a question which has suddenly become one of the most pressing, as
it has long been one of the most important, with which the statesmen
of the present day are called upon to grapple."&mdash;<i>Nottingham Guardian.</i></p>

<p>"A trustworthy and interesting picture of a noble life and
character."&mdash;<i>Daily News.</i></p>

<p>"A sober, solid, but interesting contribution to the political history
of the Victorian epoch."&mdash;<i>Daily Telegraph.</i></p>

<p>"The book should be read by every one who takes the least interest
in the political history of the country."&mdash;<i>Daily Chronicle.</i></p>

<p>"An elaborate and ably-written biography of Mr. Gladstone as a
statesman and a writer."&mdash;<i>Echo.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Barnett Smith's Life of Mr. Gladstone is <i>a work of national
importance</i>, and it should be read and studied by all classes."&mdash;<i>Nottingham
Daily Express.</i></p>

<p>"Many a thoughtful working man will hasten to add this book to his
little store of fondly-cherished volumes."&mdash;<i>North British Daily Mail.</i></p>

<p>"A very complete account of Mr. Gladstone's relations to the
history of the past forty years."&mdash;<i>Observer.</i></p>

<p>"A noble biography of a noble man."&mdash;<i>Aberdeen Free Press.</i></p>

<p>"The minute accuracy of the painstaking record is indeed wonderful,
considering the vastness of the field over which the biographer has been
obliged to travel. <i>The volumes are, in fact, a history of England
during the past half century</i>, as well as a biography of the individual
whose name they bear."&mdash;<i>Freeman.</i></p>

<p>"The most superficial glance at the book is enough to secure the
impression of great power in many departments on the part of the
subject of it, and of great penetration, care, deliberation, and tact on
the part of the author."&mdash;<i>Nonconformist.</i></p>

which has yet been compiled and given to the public."&mdash;<i>Edinburgh
